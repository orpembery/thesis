\paragraph{Structure}

The structure should be (each is a section)

\bit
\item Setup of final problem, main result.
\item Generic MLMC theory for non-path-dependent levels, but $k$-dependence everything.
\item $k^{-3/2}$ generic theory
\item Applying generic theory to HH IIP/EDP \emph{with $A=I$ and a scatterer} to obtain main result.
\bit
\item Specify exact setup (domain etc. as in $k^{3/2}$, stochasitc side, specify model as in stochastic (but give concrete example) and quote from stochastic about well-posedness, bounds, etc.)
\item Explicit proof for $H^2$ constants
\item Show everything (mehs condition, a priori bound) is ok and path independent
\item seriving values of $\alpha$ etc. for different scenarios
\item putting it all together to get mlmc results
\item compare to mc

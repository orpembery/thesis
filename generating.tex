\subsection{Random fields satisfying \cref{con:hh-hetero}}\label{sec:generating}
The main focus of this \lcnamecref{chap:stochastic} is proving well-posedness of the variational formulations of the stochastic Helmholtz equation, and a priori bounds on the solution, for the most-general class of $A$ and $n$ allowed by the deterministic bounds in \cite{GrPeSp:19}. However, in this section, motivated by the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (see e.g.~\cite[p.~201ff.]{LoPoSh:14}) and similar expansions of material coefficients for the stationary diffusion equation \cite[Section 2.1]{KuNu:16}, we consider $A$ and $n$ as series expansions around known non-random fields $\Az$ and $\nz$ satisfying \cref{con:hh-hetero} (i.e., \cref{con:hh-hetero} is satisfied for $\nz, \Az$ independent of $\omega \in \Omega$, and therefore $\muo,\mut$ independent of $\omega$).
Define
\beq\label{eq:nseries}
A(\omega,\bx) = \Az(\bx) + \sum_{j=1}^\infty \Yj(\omega) \Psij(\bx)\quad\text{and}\quad n(\omega,\bx) = \nz(\bx) + \sum_{j=1}^\infty\Zj(\omega) \psij(\bx) ,
\eeq
where:
\bit
\item $\supp\mleft(1-\Az\mright),\,\supp \mleft(I-\nz\mright) \compcont \BR,$
\item $\Az$ and $\nz$ satisfy \cref{con:hh-hetero} with $\muo$ and $\mut$ independent of $\omega \in \Omega$
\item $\Yj,\Zj \sim \Unif(-1/2,1/2)$ i.i.d.,
\item $\Psij \in \WoiDRRRdtd$ with $\supp \Psij \compcont \BR$ for all $j =1,\ldots,m$,
\beq\label{eq:Apsimeas}
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \NWoiDRRRdtd{\Psij} < \infty, \tand
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:Apsipos}
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \esssup_{\bx \in \DR} \NopCCd{\Psij} < 2\Azmin,
\eeq
where $\Azmin > 0$ is such that $\Azmin\abs{\bxi}^2 \leq \big(A(\bx)\bxi\big)\cdot \bxi$ for almost every $\bx \in \Dp$ and for all $\bxi \in \CCd$.
\item $\psij \in \WoiDRRR$ with $\supp \psij \compcont \BR$ for all $j = 1,\ldots,m$,
\beq\label{eq:npsimeas}
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \NWoiDRRR{\psij} < \infty, \tand
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:npsipos}
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \NLiDRRR{\psij} < 2 \nzmin,
\eeq
where $\nzmin \de \essinf_{\bx \in \DR} \nz(\bx).$

%Regarding the measurability of $n$ and $A$ defined by \eqref{eq:nseries}: the proof for this particular setting of mappings into a separable subspace of a general normed vector space is analagous to the proof in the case of a sum of real-valued measurable mappings, and so we do not give it here.

The assumptions \eqref{eq:Apsipos} and \eqref{eq:npsipos} ensure that $A > 0$ (in the sense of quadratic forms) and $n > 0$  almost surely, and the assumptions \eqref{eq:Apsimeas} and \eqref{eq:npsimeas} are used to prove $A$ and $n$ are measurable.

Regarding the measurability of $A$ and $n$ defined by \eqref{eq:nseries}: the proof that $A$ and $n$ given by \eqref{eq:nseries} are measurable is given in \cref{lem:seriesmeas}, and relies on the proof that the sum of measurable functions
is measurable. This latter result is standard, but we have not been able to find this result for this particular setting of mappings
into a separable subspace of a general normed vector space, and so we briefly give it in \cref{lem:summeas}. 

The following lemmas give sufficient conditions for the series in \eqref{eq:nseries} to satisfy \cref{con:hh-hetero}.

\ble[Series expansion of $A$ satisfies \cref{con:hh-hetero}]\label{lem:Agen}
Let $\mu > 0$, $\delta \in \mleft(0,1\mright).$ If $\Az \in \NTA{\mu},$ and
\beq\label{eq:Aseriescond}
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \esssup_{\bx \in \DR} \NopCCd{\Psij(\bx) - \mleft(\bx\cdot\grad\mright)\Psij(\bx)} \leq 2\delta\mu,
\eeq
then $A \in \NTA{(1-\delta)\mu}$ almost surely.
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:Agen}]
Since $\Az \in \NTA{\mu},$ we have 
\beq\label{eq:Aseries1}
\Big(\mleft(A(\omega,\bx) - \mleft(\bx\cdot\grad\mright)A(\omega,\bx)\mright)\bxi\Big)\cdot\bxib \geq\mu \abs{\bxi}^2+\sum_{j=1}^\infty  \Big(\Yj(\omega)\mleft(\Psij(\bx)- \mleft(\bx\cdot\grad\mright)\Psij(\bx)\mright)\bxi\Big)\cdot\bxib
\eeq
for all $\bxi \in \CCd,$ for almost every $\bx \in \DR,$ almost surely. As $\Yj \sim \Unif(-1/2,1/2)$ for all $j$ and the bound \eqref{eq:Aseriescond} holds, the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:Aseries1} is bounded below by
\beqs
\mu \abs{\bxi}^2 -\half 2\delta \mu \abs{\bxi}^2 = (1-\delta)\mu\abs{\bxi}^2\text{ almost surely.}
\eeqs
Since $\bxi \in \CCd$ was arbitrary, it follows that $A(\omega) \in \NTA{(1-\delta)\mu)}$ almost surely, as required.
\epf

\ble[Series expansion of $n$ satisfies \cref{con:hh-hetero}]\label{lem:ngen}
Let $\mu > 0$ and $\delta \in \mleft(0,1\mright).$ If $\nz \in \NTn{\mu}$ and
\beq\label{eq:nseriescond}
\sum_{j=1}^m\NLiDRRR{\psij(\bx) + \bx\cdot\grad\psij(\bx)} \leq 2\delta\mu,
\eeq
then $n \in \NTn{(1-\delta)\mu}.$
\ele

The proof of \cref{lem:ngen} is omitted, since it is similar to the proof of \cref{lem:Agen}; in fact it is simpler, because it involves scalars rather than matrices.

All of the computations in this thesis were performed with the following computational setup, unless otherwise stated.

\paragraph{PDE/FEM:}
The PDE we solve is the Interior Impedance Problem, i.e., \cref{prob:vtedp} with $\Dm = \emptyset,$ posed on the 2-d unit square; $D = [0,1]^2.$ We use first-order continuous finite elements, with $h = k^{-3/2}$. We use regular grids, see \cref{fig:grid} for an example grid. Where we needed to calculate a preconditioner $\AmatoI,$ we calculated the exact $LU$ decomposition of $\Amato$.

\paragraph{Numerical setup}
All finite-element calculations were carried out using the Firedrake software library \cite{RaHaMiLaLuMcBeMaKe:16,LuVaRaBeRaHaKe:15}, which uses PETSc to perform its linear solves \cite{BaAbAsBrBrBuDaEiGrKaKnMaMcMiMuRuSaSmZaZhZh:18,BaGrMcSm:97,DaPaKlCo:11,BaAbAdBrBrBuDaDeEiGrKaKaKnMaMcMiMuRuSaSmZaZh:19} and Chaco \cite{HeLe:95} to perform graph partitions. PETSc uses the MUMPS \cite{AmDuLEKo:01,AmGuLEPr:06} solver to perform $LU$ factorisations and direct solves. When GMRES was used, the stopping criterion was a relative error (relative to the 2-norm of the right-hand side) of $10^{-5}$ or an absolute error of $10^{-50}.$ To generate QMC points, we made use of Dirk Nuyen's `Magic Point Shop' code \cite{Nu,KuNu:16}, which uses a base-2 lattice sequence with generating vector from \cite{CoKuNu:06}. Many of the computations were carried out on the Balena High Performance Computing (HPC) Service at the University of Bath.

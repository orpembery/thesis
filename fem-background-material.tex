\section{Theory of the Finite-Element Discretisation of the Helmholtz Equation}\label{sec:helmfe}

We now shift our attention to the numerical analysis of the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media; in particular, we  study the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation. We first state the variational formulations of the Helmholtz equation, define the finite element method, and recall results on the approximation properties of finite-element spaces. we then prove our main result, error bounds for the finite-element method for the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation, where the bounds hold for arbitrary (fixed) degree finite elements, and are explicit in $n$ and (in principle) $A$.

a new error bound for the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media.

  \subsection{Variational Formulations for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:varform}
  The finite element method is based on the variational formulation of the Helmholtz equation; for simplicity of exposition, we state the variational formulation of \cref{prob:edp,prob:tedp} in the case $\gD = 0,$ although these can be generalised to the case $\gD \neq 0.$
  
\bprob[Variational formulation of EDP when $\gD = 0$]\label{prob:vedp}
Let $\Dp, A, n,$ and $f$ be as in \cref{prob:edp}. Choose $R>0$ such that $\supp f,$ $\supp(I-A),$ $\supp(1-n) \compcont \BR,$ and define $\DR \de \Dp \cap \BR.$

We say $u \in \HozDDR$ satisfies the \defn{variational formulation of the exterior Dirichlet problem} with $\gD = 0$ if
\beqs
\aE(u,v) = \FE(v)\quad \tfa v \in \HozDDR,
\eeqs
where
\beq\label{eq:aedp}
\aE(w,v) \de \int_{\DR} \mleft(\mleft(A \grad w\mright)\cdot\grad \vbar - k^2 n\minispace w \vbar\mright) - \DPGR{\DtN \trGR w}{\trGR v}
\eeq
and
\beq\label{eq:Ledp}
\FE(v) \de \int_{\DR} f\minispace\vbar,
\eeq
where $\DtN:\HhGR\rightarrow \HmhGR$ is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation $\Lap u + k^2 u = 0$ combined with the Sommerfeld radiation condition in the exterior of $\BR$; and $\DPGR{\cdot}{\cdot}$ is the duality pairing on $\GR.$
\eprob

\ble[Equivalence of formulations for the EDP]\label{lem:edpform}
\Cref{prob:edp,prob:vedp} are equivalent. If $u \in \HolocDp$ solves \cref{prob:edp} then $u\restrict_{\DR} \in \HozDDR$ and $u\restrict_{\DR}$ solves \cref{prob:vedp}  (for $R$ as in \cref{prob:vedp}). Conversely, if $u \in \HozDDR$ solves \cref{prob:vedp}, then $u$ solves \cref{prob:edp}, if $u$ is extended to $\HolocDp$ by the solution of the exterior Dirichlet problem (in the exterior of $\DR$) for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation with the Sommerfeld radiation condition (with Dirichlet data $\tr u$ on $\partial \BR$).

\bprob[Variational formulation of TEDP when $\gD = 0$]\label{prob:vtedp}
Let $D, A, n, f,$ and $\gI$ be as in \cref{prob:tedp}. We say $u \in \HozDDR$ satisfies the \defn{variational formulation of the truncated exterior Dirichlet problem} with $\gD = 0$ if
\beq\label{eq:vtedp}
\aT(u,v) = \FT(v) \tfa v \in \HozDDR,
\eeq
where
\beq\label{eq:aT}
\aT(w,v) \de \int_{D} \big(\mleft(A \grad w\mright)\cdot\grad \vbar - k^2 n\minispace w \vbar\big) - ik\int_{\GI} \trGI w\minispace\trGI \vbar
\eeq
and
\beqs
\FT(v) \de \int_{D} f\minispace\vbar + \int_{\GI} \gI \minispace\trGI \vbar
\eeqs
\eprob

\ble[Equivalence of formulations for the TEDP]\label{lem:tedpform}
\Cref{prob:tedp,prob:vtedp} are equivalent, i.e., $u \in \HozDDR$ solves \cref{prob:tedp} if, and only if, $u$ solves \cref{prob:vtedp}.

\subsection{Background Concepts in Finite-Element Theory}\label{sec:fetheory}

We now give a brief summary of elementary concepts in finite-element theory. In the interest of brevity, we focus only on those concepts that we be needed to
prove the new error bound for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation in \cref{sec:fem} below.

Throughout this thesis, we use the terms `mesh` and `triangulation' to refer to a triangulation of simplices in the sense of Ciarlet \cite[Paragraphs (FEM1) p. 61 and ($\cT_{h}$5) p. 71]{Ci:91}. Similarly, we use $h$ to denote the mesh size of a mesh\footnote{Frequently in this thesis we will consider families of meshes indexed by their mesh size $h$.}, and we use $\Vhp$ to denote the set of continuous piecewise-polynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh with mesh size $h$.
  %%   triangulation of the domain. (Note that in this thesis we use the words `mesh' and `triangulation' interchangably; strictly speaking, the term `triangulation' only makes sense in 2-d, but we ignore this technicality.

  %%   \bde[Triangulation]
  %%   A triangulation of a polygonal domain $D$ is a finite collection of sets $\Ki \subseteq \Dclos$ such that
  %%   \ben
  %% \item $\interior{\Ki} \cap \interior{\Kj} = \emptyset$ for $ i \neq j,$
  %% \item $\bigcup_i \Ki = \Dclos,$ and

%% \beqs
%% h = \max_{\Ki} \diam{\Ki}.
%% \eeqs

%%     We can now define finite-element spaces associated with a triangulation; we first define the space of polynomials on a set.

%%     Given a triangulation $\set{\Ki}$ with mesh size $h$ of a domain $D$, the \defn{(continuous) piecewise-polynomial finite-element space of degree $p$} associated with $\set{\Ki}$ is
%%     \beqs

%%     \ede

Throughout this thesis, we only consider the $h$-finite-element method, i.e., the degree $p$ of the polynomials associated with the space is assumed fixed, and we consider refining $h.$ This is in contrast to the $p$-finite-element method, where $h$ is fixed and $p$ is increased, and the $hp$-finite-element method, where both $h$ and $p$ are increased according to some rule. $hp$-finite-element methods for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation were analysed by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}; however, their analysis relies on a fully $p$-explicit analysis of the best approximation error of the Helmholtz equation in $hp$-finite-element spaces; such analysis is currently not possible for the heterogeneous problem. Throughout this \lcnamecref{sec:fetheory} we use finite-element method to refer to the $h$-finite-element method.

%% The function $\vhptilde$ in \cref{lem:scottzhang} can be constructed using `averaged Taylor polynomials', see, e.g., \cite{ScZh:90},\cite[Section 4.4]{BrSc:08} for details\footnote{Observe that in \cite{BrSc:08}, the authors use different notation to us; they use $m$ to denote the regularity of $v$ and $p$ to denote the integrability of $v,$ i.e., in \cite{BrSc:08}, $v \in \WmpD.$}.
%%     \ere

    With the concept of a finite-element space in place, we can now define the finite-element approximation to the variational problems \cref{prob:vedp,prob:vtedp}.

    \bprob[Finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vtedp}]\label{prob:fevtedp}
    We say that $\uh \in \Vhp$ is the \defn{finite-element approximation of $u$} (the solution to \cref{prob:vtedp}) if
    \beqs
    \aT(\uh,\vh) = \FT(\vh) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
    \eeqs
    The finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vedp} is defined analagously.
    \eprob

    The following \lcnamecref{lem:scottzhang} shows how the approximation properties of the space $\Vhp$ depend on $h$ and $p$:

    \beqs

    \eeqs
    \ele

    
    \bre[Not considering variational crimes]
    Throughout this thesis we assume that \cref{prob:fevtedp} is a conforming discretisation if \cref{prob:vtedp}, i.e. $\Vhp \subset \HozDDR.$ This inclusion is true if $\DR$ can be triangulated; otherwise, we must modify the definition of \cref{prob:fevtedp} and commit a variational crime by approximating the boundary of $\DR$ by a polygon, or introducing mesh elements with curved boundaries using interpolated boundary conditions or isoparametric finite elements. See, e.g., \cite[Chapter 10]{BrSc:08} for an overview of the additional errors introduced by variational crimes (although not in the context of the Helmholtz equation). In this thesis we  ignore such variational crimes, and the additional errors they induce; such analysis is standard. Therefore for the remainder of this thesis we assume that \cref{lem:scottzhang} holds, even if we have not triangulated the domain $D$ exactly.

%%     \subsection{Error bound for the heterogeneous IIP}\label{sec:errbound}

%%     We now move on to present new work---bounds on the error $\uh-u$ between the finite-element approximation and the true solution of \cref{prob:vtedp}. These bounds, proven here for the Helmholtz equation in \emph{heterogeneous} media are generalisations of results already in the literature that the finite-element error in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms is bounded (as $k\rightarrow \infty$) provided $h \lesssim k^{-(2p+1)/2p}$. These results are crucial for our analysis of the multi-level Monte Carlo method for the Helmholtz equation in \cref{chap:mlmc}.

%% The proof of these results uses a so-called `elliptic projection' technique, introduced by Feng and Wu in \cite{FeWu:09} for Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Helmholtz equation and modified by Du and Wu \cite{DuWu:15}, where the variational formulation of a PDE related to \cref{prob:vtedp} is used as part of the proof. We  only prove results for \cref{prob:fevtedp}, and not for the finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vedp}, as our proof uses properties of the related PDE and these properties have only been proven with impedance boundary conditions (in the recent preprint \cite{ChNiTo:18}) and not with an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the truncation boundary. However, we imagine the results proven for the related PDE with an impedance boundary condition also hold for an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition, and so we anticipate that the results we prove here also hold for finite-element approximations of \cref{prob:vedp}.\opntodo{This paragraph needs rewriting---acknowledge Du \& Wu}

\subsection{Discussion of the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:helmfedisc}

We now discuss three properties of the $h$-finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation:
\bit
\item The relative error $\displaystyle \frac{\NHokD{u-\uh}}{\NHokD{u}}$ is bounded,
\item The error $\NHokD{u-\uh}$ is bounded in terms of norms of the data $f$ and $\gI$, and
  \item The finite-element method is quasi-optimal, $\displaystyle \NHokD{u-\uh} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NHokD{u-\vh}.$
    \eit

    The key question we ask is: What mesh conditions lead to each of the three properties above? (I.e., how must one refine $h$ as $k$ increases in order for the finite-element method to satisfy each of the three properties above?)

    We will now summarise the state of the literature regarding each of the three properties above. We will:
    \ben
  \item Define each of the three properties formally,
  \item\label{it:sum2} State the sharpest results known in the literature,
  \item\label{it:sum3} Give a complete overview of all results in the literature concerning the three properties,and
    \item\label{it:sum4} Give a detailed discussion of proof techniques for each of the three properties.
      \een

We do \cref{it:sum2,it:sum3} because to our knowledge there is not a complete overview of all of these three properties anywhere in the literature. Moreover, research interest in these three properties has recently increased (e.g., the recent papers \cite{ChNi:18,LiWu:18,ChGaNiTo:18,ChNi:19} are all concerned with one or more of these properties, and have all been completed within the last two years), and so we believe it will be helpful and timely to provide a complete overview of the state of the literature. We do \cref{it:sum4} because collection of the proof techniques used for each of these properties are different to those used for standard finite-element proofs for, e.g., the stationary diffusion equation. Moreover, the different proof techniques are different but related, and we do not know of anywhere in the literature where these techniques are expounded, compared, and constrasted. In view of the resurgence in interest in the properties above, we hope that such a review will be valuable for the research community.

      

\paragraph{Intuition for fixed number of points per wavelength} Before discussing the three properties listed above, we first give a brief discussion of the commonly-used heuristic `take a fixed number of points (or elements) per wavelength'.  Recall from \cref{sec:numsolve} that if one takes the mesh size in the finite element method $h \sim 1/k$, then one expects the interpolation (or best approximation) error is bounded uniformly in $k$. More rigorously, as solutions of the Helmholtz equation typically\footnote{If $f$ and $\gD$ are independent of $k$,  combining \cref{thm:edp} and standard elliptic regularity results, e.g., \cite[Theorems 4.16 and 4.18]{Mc:00}, gives the fact that $\NHtD{u} \lesssim k$.} have $\NHtD{u} \sim k,$ one can bound the $H^1$-norm of the interpolation error if $h \sim 1/k$ using \cref{lem:scottzhang}.  As explained in \cref{sec:numsolve}, this restriction ensures there are a fixed number of discretisation points per wavelength of the solution, since the wavelength $\lambda = 2\pi/k.$

An alternative motivation for taking $h \sim 1/k$ is the Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem (proved by Shannon in his seminal paper in information theory \cite[Theorem 1]{Sh:49}). The theorem states that any function $v$ (in 1-d) whose Fourier transform lies inside $[-k,k]$, for some $k>0$, is completely determined (via its Fourier series) by the point values $v(0)$, $v(\pm \mu),$ $v(\pm2\mu),  \ldots$, for any $\mu < 1/\mleft(2k\mright).$ Observe that $k$ is then the highest frequency present in $v$.  That is, if we interpolate $v$ at points spaced less than $ \lambda/(4\pi)=1/(2k)$ apart, where $\lambda = 2\pi/k$ is the wavelength associated with oscillations of frequency $k$, we can reconstruct $v$ from its Fourier transform. See, e.g., \cite[\S 5.21]{BaNaBe:00} for an explicit formula for reconstructioning $v$. Therefore, in the 1-d case we may reasonably expect that interpolating $v$ with points spaced less than $\lambda/(4\pi)$ apart will be a good approximation of $v$, as the Nyquist--Shannon theorem suggests such a spacing of points `captures' all of the oscillations in $v.$
%% The solution of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with constant coefficients is
%% \beq\label{eq:hh-1d}
%% u(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx),
%% \eeq
%% (for some constants $A$ and $B$), and $\lambda = k/2\pi$ as $u$ has Fourier Transform
%% \beqs
%% \uhat(\xi) = \frac{A}{2i} \mleft(\delta\mleft(\xi-\frac{k}{2\pi}\mright) - \delta\mleft(\xi+\frac{k}{2\pi}\mright)\mright) + \frac{B}{2} \mleft(\delta\mleft(\xi-\frac{k}{2\pi}\mright) + \delta\mleft(\xi+\frac{k}{2\pi}\mright)\mright).
%% \eeqs
%% \opntodo{Find reference}
%% Therefore, if $u$ is sampled at regularly-spaced points that are strictly closer together than $\pi/k = 1/(2\lambda)$, then $u$ can be reconstructed perfectly from these samples.\opntodo{Consider writing something about mutliple dimensions} In conclusion, one expects the be able to interpolate the solution of the Helmholtz equation with uniform error in $k$ if $h \sim 1/k.$

%% However, as was stated in \cref{sec:numsolve}, the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation suffers from pollution; and $h \sim 1/k$ is not sufficient to keep the finite-element error bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty.$ Therefore we  now provide an overview of previous work giving mesh conditions under which the finite-element error $\NW{u-\uh}$ is bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty$, as well as mesh conditions under which the finite-element method is quasi-optimal. Concerning errors, it would be more natural to consider the relative error $\NW{u-\uh}/\NW{u};$ and to investigate the conditions on $h$ which enable the relative error to be bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty.$ However, current technology typically only allows us to prove results for the error, not the relative error, and so we investigate the error instead.

%We will now briefly review the literature that seeks to answer the question `What mesh condition will keep the relative error bounded as $k \rightarrow \infty$?'


%% \bde[Bounded finite-element error]
%% Let $(\Th)_{h \in (0,1)}$ be a shape-regular family of triangulations of $\DR$, where we assume $h$ is a function of $k$ (e.g., $h(k) = 1/k$). We say that \defn{the error in the finite-element method is bounded uniformly in $k$} if for all $A,n$ in some class there exists $C(A,n)$ (but independent of $k$ and $h$) such that
%% \beqs
%% \NW{u-\uh} \leq C\mleft(\NLtD{f} + \NLtGD{\gD} + \NLtGI{\gI}\mright).
%% \eeqs
%% \ede



 %% In $d=2$ or $3$ with $D$ a convex polygon or polyhedron,  \cite[Theorem 6.1]{Wu:14} showed that the error (but not the relative error) in both the $H^1$ seminorm and the $L^2$ norm is bounded uniformly in $k$ if $h \lesssim k^{-3/2}$. The proof of \cite[Theorem 6.1]{Wu:14} showed an analagous result for a continuous interior-penalty method, and then took the limit as the penalty parameter tends to 0 to obtain the result for the continuous piecewise-linear finite-element method. In summary, the mesh condition $h \lesssim k^{-3/2}$ seems to be sufficient for the (relative) error to be bounded uniformly in $k.$

\subsubsection{Formal definition of properties of the finite-element method}\label{sec:femprops}

We now formally define the three properties mentioned above. These definitions may seem overly technical, however we believe their technical definition is necessary to capture the, at times, complex behaviour of finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation. After stating the definitions, we give some examples of what they mean for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation. These definitions are based on \cite[Definition 2.3]{DiMoSp:19}.

In the following definitions, we consider the Helmholtz problems \cref{prob:vtedp}, and their discretisations \cref{prob:fevtedp} as parameterised by the wavenumber $k,$ that is, we write $u(k)$ for the solution of \cref{prob:vtedp} with wavenumber $k$, and $\uh(k)$ for its finite-element approximation.

\bde[$\hk{a}{b}$-accurate]\label{def:hkacc}
Given $a,b>0$, we that an $h$-finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is \defn{$\hk{a}{b}$-accurate} if, given $0 < \eps < 1,$ and $\kz > 0,$ there exist $\Co(\kz), \Ct(\eps,\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^a \leq \Co
\eeqs
and
\beqs
hk^b \leq \Ct,
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beq\label{eq:hkacc}
\frac{\NHokD{u(k)-\uh(k)}}{\NHokD{u(k)}} \leq \eps
\eeq
for all $k \geq \kz.$

If $a=b$ we say the $h$-finite-element method is $\hka{a}$-accurate.
\ede

\bde[$\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate]\label{def:hkdataacc}
Given $a,b>0$, we that an $h$-finite-element method for \cref{prob:vtedp} is \defn{$\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate} if, given $0 < \eps < 1,$ and $\kz > 0,$ there exist $\Co(\kz), \Ct(\eps,\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^a \leq \Co
\eeqs
and
\beqs
hk^b \leq \Ct,
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beq\label{eq:hkdataacc}
\frac{\NHokD{u(k)-\uh(k)}}{\NLtD{f} + \NLtGI{\gI}} \leq \eps
\eeq
for all $k \geq \kz.$

If $a=b$ we say the $h$-finite-element method is $\hka{a}$-data-accurate.
\ede

Observe that the only difference between the definitions of $\hk{a}{b}$-accurate and $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate is that in \cref{eq:hkacc} the error is measured relative to the solution $u$, whereas in \cref{eq:hkdataacc} the error is measure relative to the `data' $f$ and $\gI$.

\bde[$\hka{a}$-quasi-optimal]\label{def:hkqo}
Given $a > 0,$ we say that an $h$-finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is \defn{$\hka{a}$-quasi-optimal} if, given $\kz > 0$, there exist $\Co(\kz), \Cqo(\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^{a} \leq \Co,
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beqs
\NHokD{u(k) - \uh(k)} \leq \Cqo \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NHokD{u(k) - \vh},
\eeqs
for all $k \geq \kz.$
\ede

\bre[Generalisations of $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate]
For discretisations of other Helmholtz problems (e.g., full-space problems with no truncation boundary $\GI$, or problems truncated with a perfectlly matched layer (PML)), then the denominator in \cref{eq:hkdataacc} should be adapted appropriately, e.g., the denominator should equal $\NLtD{f}$ for full-space problems and PML problems. In our discussion of the literature below (which includes such problems), we will make such an adaption without comment.
\ere

\bre[Relationship between $\hk{a}{b}$-accuracy and $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accuracy]
Observe that if an a priori bound such as \cref{eq:tedpbound} holds, then $\hk{a}{b}$-accuracy implies $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy, as $\NHokD{u} \lesssim \NLtD{f} + \NLtGI{\gI}$.

However, in order to conclude $\hk{a}{b}$-accuracy from $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy, one would need to show
\beq\label{eq:reversebound}
\NLtD{f} \lesssim \NHokD{u}.
\eeq
However, in general \cref{eq:reversebound} does not hold\ednote{Euan---can one write down an example of this \emph{easily}?}, and so one cannot, in general, conclude $\hk{a}{b}$-accuracy from $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accuracy.
\ere

\bre[The above conditions for heterogeneous problems]
Observe that for heterogeneous problems, the constants $\Co, \Ct$, and $\Cqo$ in \cref{def:hkacc,def:hkdataacc,def:hkqo} will all depend on the coefficients $A$ and $n.$ In general, this dependence is unknown. However, in our original work in \cref{sec:fem} below we prove that the $h$-finite-element method with polynomial degree $p$ is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate, where the dependence of $\Co$ and $\Ct$ on $n$ (and, in principle, $A$) is completely known.
\ere

To aid understanding of the above definitions, and to see how they connect with the usual presentation of finite-element results for the Helmholtz equation, we give the following illustrative example.

\bre[Example achieving $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accuracy]\label{rem:dataacc}
In \cite[Theorem 5.4]{ChGaNiTo:18}, Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise, and Tomezyk proved\footnote{The result proved in \cite[Theorem 5.4]{ChGaNiTo:18} is slightly more complicated than that stated here; the right-hand side of \cref{eq:hkacceg} should be $\Cth \mleft(hk + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{f}.$ However, an analagous proof to the one presented here holds in the more complicated case.} that if $k \geq \kz$ and $h^{p+1}k^{p+2} \leq \Co$, then
\beq\label{eq:hkacceg}
\NHokD{u(k) - \uh(k)} \leq \Cth h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\NLtD{f}
\eeq
for some $\kz, \Co, \Cth > 0.$

For $0 < \eps < 1,$ if we take $\Ct = \eps/\Cth$ then it follows that the $h$-finite-element method is $\hk{(p+2)/(p+1)}{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-accurate.

We choose this example to illustrate:
\bit
\item That it is not always the case that $a=b$; here $a > b.$
\item That sometimes (as in this case) $a > b.$ I.e., whilst the mesh constraint `$hk^b$ sufficiently small' makes the finite-element error small, one can only apply this mesh constraint under the more restrictive mesh constraint `$hk^a$ sufficiently small'. Therefore, this result is somewhat limited in its practical applicability.
\eit

\subsubsection{Optimal mesh conditions for the finite-element method}

We now provide a brief overview of the optimal values of $a$ and $b$ for $\hk{a}{b}$-accuracy, $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accuracy, and $\hka{a}$-quasi-optimality. By `optimal', we mean the values of $a$ and $b$ that are smallest; these will correspond to the least restrictive conditions on the mesh size $h$. We will also, where possible, comment on whether these optimal conditions have been shown to be sharp. The literature reviews in this, and the next, section draw heavily on the literature reviews in \cite[pp. 182--183]{GrLoMeSp:14} and \cite[p. 112]{DiMoSp:19}. Unless otherwise stated, all the problems treated in this literature review are nontrapping (in the wider sense discussed under `\techtitle' in \cref{sec:wpdisc}), have constant coefficients, and and have a impedance boundary condition on at least part of the boundary.

\paragraph{$\hk{a}b$-accuracy} In 1-d the $h$-finite-element method has been proved to be $\hka{3/2}$-accurate for first-order finite elements by Ihlenburg and Babu\v{s}ka in \cite[Theorem 5 and Equation (3.25)]{IhBa:95a} and \cite[Equation (4.5.15)]{Ih:98}. For higher-order finite-elements (still in 1-d) they proved the $h$-finite-element method is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-accurate in \cite[Corollary 3.2]{IhBa:97} and \cite[Theorem 4.27 and Equation 4.7.41]{Ih:98}. However, all the above results were only measured in the $H^1$ seminorm (and so we are slightly abusing the notation of $\hka{a}$-accuracy here), and the higher-order results were proved under the assumptions that $f \in \HpmoD,$ $u \in \HppoD,$ and $\SNHppoD{u} \sim k^p \SNHoD{u}.$ In addition, these results were proved using the properties of the `discrete Green's function' for the Helmholtz equation. This function was used to first prove an a priori bound on the finite-element approximation of the solution, and the error bounds were then concluded from this a priori bound. As the discrete Green's function is only known explicitly in 1-d, these results have not been generalised to higher dimensions.

These $\hk{a}b$-accuracy results were confirmed numerically (for $p=1$) by \cite[Figure 11]{IhBa:95a} and \cite[Figure 4.13]{Ih:98}, which showed that the relative error is bounded if $h \sim k^{-3/2}$ and by \cite[Figure 4.10]{Ih:98}, which showed that the relative error is not bounded if $h \sim k^{-1}.$ We note that the proofs in \cite{IhBa:95a,Ih:98} showed the finite-element error was bounded by $\SNHppoD{u}$, and then used the fact that
\beq\label{eq:ratio1d}
\frac{\SNHppoD{u}}{\SNHoD{u}} \sim k^p
\eeq
to bound the finite-element error by $\SNHoD{u},$ and hence conclude a bound on the relative error.

The relation \cref{eq:ratio1d} follows because the solution of the Helmholtz equation in 1-d is given by
\beq\label{eq:soln1d}
A \cos(kx) + B \sin(kx)
\eeq
(for some constants $A$ and $B$). Because \cref{eq:soln1d} only holds in 1-d, and therefore one can, in general, only prove \cref{eq:ratio1d} in 1-d, the proofs of $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-accuracy have not been extended to higher dimensions, although we conjecture they are true. The only computational results for higher dimensions are those by Bayliss, Goldstein, and Turkel, who showed in \cite[Section 3, Tables 1--3]{BaGoTu:85} that, for low wavenumbers $k \in (4.16,8.32)$ the relative error for first-order finite-elements is bounded if $h \sim k^{-3/2}$, but is not bounded if $h \sim k^{-1}.$

\paragraph{$\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy} In contrast to $\hk{a}b$-accuracy, there are many proofs (for different polynomial degrees and for different Helmholtz problems) of $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy. The reason for far more proofs in this case is that one can usually show that the interpolation error $u -\Ih u$ is bounded by the data, and one can use this bound when bounding the finite-element error to conclude the finite-element error is bounded by the data.

The best results known to date are the same (in terms of $a$ and $b$) as those for $\hk{a}b$-accuracy, except results for $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy hold in higher dimensions. In \cite[Theorem 5.1, Corollary 5.2]{DuWu:15} Du and Wu proved that the $h$-finite-element method for the IIP is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate for arbitrary (fixed) polynomial degree $p$ and $d = 2$ or $3$, provided $u \in \HppoD$ (although this result can be shown for lower-regularity solutions by combining \cite[Theorem 5.1]{DuWu:15} with \cite[Lemma 3.5]{DuWu:15}). This result was proved for the IIP in $d = 2$ or $3$ for $p=1$ by Wu in \cite{Wu:14}. The only computational evidence we know that in some way  confirms the sharpness of this result is that of Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise \cite[Section 6.3, Figure 9]{ChNi:18}. They show that for scattering by a re-entrant corner, the relative $L^2$-error is bounded independently of $k$ provided $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is bounded, for $p = 1,2,$ and $6.$ However, in general the result for $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy coincides with the (sharp) best case for $\hk{a}b$-accuracy (in terms of the valuyes of $a$ and $b$), and so we expect the result for $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy is also sharp.

\paragraph{$\hka{a}$-quasi-optimality} Finally, the best known result for $\hka{a}$-quasi-optimality for the Helmholtz equation is that the $h$-finite-element method is $\hka{(p+1)/p}$-quasi-optimal. This was first proved for $p=1$ in 1-d by Aziz, Kellog, and Stevens in \cite[Theorem 3.1]{AzKeSt:88} and Ihlenburg and Babu\v{s}ka in \cite[Theorem 3]{IhBa:95a} and \cite[Theorems 4.9 and 4.13]{Ih:98}, with \cite[Figures 7-9]{IhBa:95a} and \cite[Section 4.5.4 and Figures 4.11-4.12]{Ih:98} showing this result is sharp in 1-d (although Ihlenburg and Babu\v{s}ka only work in the $H^1$-semi norm). The result was proved for $p=1$ and $d=2$ for the IIP by Melenk \cite[Proposition 8.2.7]{Me:95}, and for higher-order finite elements (for the full-space problem, IIP, and EDP) by Melenk and Sauter in \cite[Corollary 5.6]{MeSa:10} and \cite[Theorem 5.8]{MeSa:11} respectively. This result was shown for a PML problem by Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise, and Tomezyk in \cite[Theorem 5.1]{ChGaNiTo:18}, and extended to arbitrary time-harmonic wave propagation problems by Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise in \cite[Theorem 2.15]{ChNi:19}, who showed that if the constant in the a priori bound \cref{eq:bgbound} grows like $k^\alpha,$ then the $h$-finite-element method is $\hka{(p+\alpha+1)/p}$-accurate. They give numerical experiments in \cite[Figure 8]{ChNi:19} showing the sharpness of $\hka{(p+1)/p}$-quasi-optimality for $p=1, 2$ for a heterogeneous IIP.

\paragraph{Link with dispersion error} When computing on regular grids, one can mathemtically analyse the `dispersion error' of the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation; i.e., the difference between the wavenumber of the true solution $u$ (i.e., $k$) and the wavenumber of the approximation $\uh.$ We mention briefly that Ainsworth  analysed the dispersion error for the $hp$-finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation and proved the dispersion error is of the order $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ \cite[Equation (3.5)]{Ai:04}. Observe that this is the same order as the best-available results for $\hka{a}$-accuracy and $\hka{a}$-data-accuracy discussed above. Therefore, results from finite-element error analysis and dispersion analysis both suggest that the error (measured in a suitable sense in each case) is bounded if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small. See, e.g., \cite[Remark 5.3(a)]{DuWu:15} for more references on dispersion error analysis for the Helmholtz equation.

\paragraph{Observations} Observe that, in general, the mesh conditions required for quasi-optimality are more restrictive than those required for the error to be bounded. I.e., in general, if the finite-element method is $\hka{\ao}$-quasi-optimal and $\hka{\at}$-data-accurate, then $\ao > \at.$ Therefore, whilst one can show the finite-element method is $\hka{a}$-data-accurate (for some $a$) by first showing quasi-optimality, this approach will result in a more restrictive mesh condition than proving $\hka{a}$-data-accuracy directly. Also observe that the results for higher-order finite elements become less stringent as $p$ increases, i.e., the finite-element method is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate, and $(2p+1)/(2p) \downarrow 1$ as $p \rightarrow \infty.$

\paragraph{Complete summary of results in the literature} In \cref{tab:acc,tab:dataacc,tab:qo} we list all of the mathematical (as opposed to computational) results in the literature for $\hk{a}b$-accuracy, $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy, and $\hka{a}$-quasi-optimality. We list these in chronological order, with any relevant comments in the `Notes' column. The `Proof technique' column details the method used in the proof; see \cref{sec:prooftechniques} below for an extended discussion of these techniques. However, we now make a few general comments on the history of these results.

Recall that proving quasi-optimality (or an error bound) for the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is more tricky than for the stationary diffusion equation \cref{eq:stdiff}. For the stationary diffusion equation, one immediately obtains quasi-optimality for \emph{any} mesh by C\'ea's Lemma (and one then obtains that the relative error is bounded by \cref{lem:scottzhang}). We emphasise again that this result holds for any mesh, with no restriction on $h.$

However, C\'ea's Lemma relies on the coercivity of the sesquilinear form, and the sesquilinear forms arising from standard discretisations of the Helmholtz equation are not coercive for large $k$. Therefore, to prove quasi-optimality, one instead uses the so-called Schatz argument, a modification of the standard Aubin--Nitsche duality argument\footnote{First introduced by Aubin \cite{Au:67} and Nitsche \cite{Ni:68} for coercive problems.} However, using the Schatz argument, one only obtains quasi-optimality under some $k$-dependent restriction on the mresh size $h.$

The Schatz argument was first used for problems satisfying a G\r{a}rding inequality by Schatz \cite{Sc:74} and first used for Helmholtz problems by Aziz, Kellogg, and Stephens \cite{AzKeSt:88}. In \cite{AzKeSt:88} they proved that in 1-d the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is $\hka{2}$-quasi-optimal, and this result was extended to $d=2$ by Melenk \cite{Me:95} in his PhD thesis. However, the Schatz argument was first presented in the framework we use below by Sauter \cite[Section 2]{Sa:06}. Observe that for large values of $k,$ $\hka{2}$-quasi-optimality and the related mesh restriction `$hk^2$ is sufficiently small' is computationally prohibitive---it would result in linear systems of size, e.g., $~10^{12}$, for the Helmholtz equation with $k=100$ in 3-d.

Because of the severe mesh restrictions required for quasi-optimality for Helmholtz problems, recent research efforts have been focused on directly proving error bounds for the finite-element method. The key proof technique has been so-called elliptic projection ideas; these ideas are at the heart of our results in \cref{sec:fem} below, and are discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:prooftechniques} below. To our knowledge, the first use of elliptic projections to prove error estimates for Galerkin approximations was by Wheeler\footnote{Mentioned in \cite{MaNo:03}.} \cite[Theorem 3.1 ff.]{Wh:73}, who proved bounds on the error for a nonlinear parabolic problem by splitting the error into the error from an elliptic projection and the remaining error between the elliptic projection and the Galerkin approximation. The idea of using elliptic projections for Helmholtz problems was first introduced to prove error bounds for discontinuous Galerkin methods for \cref{prob:tedp} by Feng and Wu \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11}, and then used for standard finite-element methods (or closely-related continuous-interior-penalty methods) beginning with the work of Wu and Zhu \cite{ZhWu:13,Wu:14}.

In this review we do not address $hp$-finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation, that is, finite-element methods where one refines both $h$ and $p$. Such methods can be very effective; the error for such methods can converge exponentially with respect to the number of degrees of freedom (see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 4.51]{Sc:98}). However, rigorous error analysis for these methods requires finite-element-error bounds that are completely explicit in both $h$ and $p$.

The landmark results on $hp$-finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation were achieved by Melenk and Sauter \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11} who used a novel splitting of the solution of the Helmholtz equation (see the comments underneath \cref{rem:osc} below) to show that the $hp$-finite-element method is quasi-optimal if $hk/p \leq \co$ and $p \geq \ct \ln k$ (for some constants $\co,\ct>0$). Melenk and Sauter proved this result for the full-space problem in \cite{MeSa:10} and for: (i) the exterior Dirichlet problem, and (ii) the interior impedance problem in an analytic domain or a 2-d convex polygon in \cite{MeSa:11}. These results were generalised to an arbitrary 2-d Lipschitz domain by Esterhazy and Melenk in \cite[Theorem 4.2]{EsMe:12}. Other results in the literature for $hp$-finite-element methods are those of Zhu and Wu \cite[Equation (1.7)]{ZhWu:13} who showed the $hp$-finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is data-accurate\footnote{We do not use the $\hk{a}b$-accurate, etc., terminology for $hp$-methods, as it does not represent the interplay between the polynomial degree $p$ and the wavenumber $k$.} provided
\beqs
\frac{kh}p \leq C_0\mleft(\frac{p}k\mright)^{\frac1{p+1}},
\eeqs
where $C_0>0$ is some constant. Finally, in \cite[Corollary 3.2]{IhBa:97} Ihlenburg and Babu\v{s}ka proved a bound on the error for the finite-element method in 1-d that is explicit in $k,$ $h$, and $p$, although the bound is probably not sharp in $p,$ and therefore could not be used to prove results on $hp$-finite-element methods.

\subsection{Extended discussion of proof techniques for finite-element errors for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:prooftechniques}
We now discuss in some detail the proof techniques used to obtain $\hk{a}b$-accuracy, $\hk{a}b$-data-accuracy, or $\hka{a}$-quasi-optimality.  We discuss these techniques because they are related, but different, and we hope that discussing the details, and comparing and contrasting these techniques will prove helpful to the research community, and will increase understanding of proofs that are, at times, a little technical. However, we also discuss these results to set the coefficient-explicit bounds in \cref{sec:fem} below in context.

We note that frequently quasi-optimality results are refereed to as \defn{asymptotic} error estimates, and accuracy or data-accuract results (when they are proved under weaker mesh constraints than asymptotic result) are referred to as \defn{pre-asymptotic} error estimates. This terminology is used because the mesh conditions to ensure quasi-optimality are more restrictive than those for bounded error, and therefore they hold for smaller values of $h.$

For simplicity's sake, our exposition below will assume that we are treating the homogeneous Helmholtz TEDP (i.e., $A=I$ and $n=1$) with $\gI = 0,$ and that the problem is nontrapping\footnote{Recall that we say that the problem is nontrapping if we have a $k$-independent a priori bound, i.e., $C$ in \cref{eq:bgbound} is independent of $k.$}. Also, we suppress all of the constants involved, instead opting to use $\lesssim$ notation, where $a \lesssim b$ if $a \leq C b,$ with $C$ independent of $k$ and $h$. The new results we present in \cref{sec:fem} consider heterogeneous problems that may be trapping, and state all of the constants involved explicitly, at the price of being more technical to state.

\subsubsection{Merits and drawbacks of each argument}
We first briefly discuss the positive and negative points for each of the two classes of argument we will outline below: (modified) duality arguments and splitting arguments.

The merits of duality arguments are their simplicity---we will state the arguments almost in their entirety below, and they are closely related with familiar duality arguments used in finite-element-error analysis for more familiar problems, such as the stationary diffusion equation. In addition, using these arguments for higher-order finite elements (or $hp$-finite-elements) one can easily conclude error bounds under certain mesh conditions, where both the bounds and the conditions are completely $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-explicit.% Such an analysis was performed for quasi-optimality of $hp$-finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media by Melenk and Sauter \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}.

However, the main drawback of duality arguments is their lack of sharpness in the conditions imposed on $h$. For example, as detailed in \cref{rem:dataacc}, Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise and Tomezyk used a duality argument in \cite{ChGaNiTo:18} to prove that for a given Helmholtz problem the pollution term is of the order $h^2k + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ provided $h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ is sufficiently small. I.e., the mesh restriction under which they prove a finite-element error bound (`$h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ is sufficiently small') is \emph{more restrictive} than the mesh restriction needed to bound the pollution error uniformly in $k$ (namely `$h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small').

In contrast, the merit of splitting arguments is that they can give mesh conditions that are sharp in their $h$-dependence; in \cite{DuWu:15}, Du and Wu proved that the pollution term in the finite-element error is of the order $h^{2p}k^{2p+1},$ under the restriction that $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small, i.e., the mesh restriction under which they prove a finite-element error bound is \emph{of the same order} as the mesh restriction needed to bound the pollution error uniformly in $k.$

However, the drawback of splitting arguments is their complexity. They involve proving bounds on the solution of discrete Helmholtz problems; such bounds are complicated to prove, especially in the higher-order cases, and the constants involved depend on the polynomial degree $p$ in highly complicated ways. These drawbacks limit the likelihood that such bounds can be used for $hp$-finite-element methods, where the dependence on the polynomial degree must be known explicitly.


\subsubsection{(Modified) Duality arguments}
The first class of arguments we consider are (modified) duality arguments. These arguments are used to prove quasi-optimality, accuracy, and data-accuracy results; they include the more commonly known Schatz argument for Helmholtz problems. In these arguments, one uses a G\r{a}rding inequality satisfied by the Helmholtz equation to show that the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm is bounded by the best approximation error, plus error in the $L^2$ norm\footnote{Recall that for the stationary diffusion equation, one can show the finite-element error is bounded by the approximation error simply using coercivity and boundedness of the bilinear form---this is Cea's Lemma.}. One then uses a modification of the standard Aubin--Nitsche duality argument to bound the $L^2$ norm.

To show the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm is bounded by the error in the $L^2$ norm, observe
\begin{align}
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 &\leq \Re{\aT(u-\uh,u-\uh)} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2\nonumber\\
&= \Re{\aT(u-\uh,u-\vh)} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2\text{ by Galerkin orthogonality}\nonumber\\
&\lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\NHokD{u-\vh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2,\label{eq:gardingerror}
\end{align}
for any $\vh \in \Vhp.$

The Schatz argument to prove quasi-optimality, outlined below, proceeds to show (for $p=1$)
\beq\label{eq:schatzbound}
k\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim hk^2 \NHokD{u-\uh},
\eeq
and combining \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:schatzbound}, one has
\beqs
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\NHokD{u-\vh} + \mleft(hk^2\mright)^2\NHokD{u-\uh}^2
\eeqs
cancelling a factor $\NHokD{u-\uh}$ from each side, and moving the final term onto the left-hand side. one obtains quasi-optimality if $hk^2$ is sufficiently small.

In contrast, so-called \defn{elliptic-projection-modified Schatz} (`modified Schatz' for short) arguments used to prove a finite-element error bound, also outlined below, show (for $p=1$)
\beq\label{eq:epbound}
k\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim h^2k^3 \NLtD{f},
\eeq
and then combine \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:epbound} to show the finite-element error is bounded if $h^2k^3$ is sufficiently small---observe this is less restrictive than the requirement $hk^2$ is sufficiently small.
%% \begin{align}
%% \NW{u-\uh}^2 &\lesssim \NW{u-\uh}\NW{u-\vh} + h^2k^3 \NLtD{f}\nonumber\\

We will now look over the Schatz argument in more detail, before considering modified Schatz arguments. We first establish some notation that will enable us to discuss best approximation errors for solutions of Helmholtz problems. We let $\solfem:\LtD\rightarrow \HoD$ denote the solution operator for \cref{prob:vtedp} with zero impedance boundary condition, and we let $\solfems$ denote the solution operator for the corresponding adjoint problem. That is, for any $\ftilde \in \LtD$ and for all $v \in \HozDD,$
\beqs
\aT(\solfem(\ftilde),v) = \IPLtD{\ftilde}{v}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\aT(v,\solfems(\ftilde)) = \IPLtD{v}{\ftilde}.
\eeqs
One can, of course, define the corresponding solution operators in the case of non-zero impedance boundary conditions. We next define the approximability constants:
\beqs
\wba \de \sup_{\ftilde \in \LtD}\inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \frac{\NHokD{\solfem(\ftilde) - \vh}}{\NLtD{\ftilde}}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\wbaadj \de \sup_{\ftilde \in \LtD}\inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \frac{\NHokD{\solfems(\ftilde) - \vh}}{\NLtD{\ftilde}}.
\eeqs
We are changing notation slightly from that normally prevelant in the literature; notation for $\wbaadj$ was first introduced by Sauter in \cite[Section 2.2]{Sa:06}, but $\wbaadj$ was instead denoted $\tilde{\eta}$ in \cite{Sa:06}. Later, $\wbaadj$ was denoted $\eta$ in \cite[Equation (4.5)]{MeSa:10}.  When dealing purely with the Schatz argument for quasi-optimality (as in \cite[Section 2.2]{Sa:06}) one only needs consider the approximation of adjoint problems in the duality-argument step, and hence one only needs notation for $\wbaadj$. However, in our exposition of elliptic-projection-based arguments below, we will also need to consider the approximation of standard Helmholtz problems, and hence we adopt the notation above.

\paragraph{The Schatz argument} We now recap the Schatz argument for proving quasi-optimality for an indefinite sesquilinear form. This recap will allow us to see where $\wbaadj$ enters the argument, and will also allow us to compare and contrast this argument with the arguments used to obtain a bounded finite-element error using an elliptic projection.

We let $\xi \in \HozDD$ solve the adjoint Helmholtz problem
\beqs
\aT(v,\xi) = \IPLtD{v}{u-\uh} \tforall v \in \HozDD.
\eeqs
Then, taking $v = u-\uh,$ we have
\begin{align}
  \NLtD{u-\uh}^2 &= \aT(u-\uh,\xi)\label{eq:schatz0}\\
  &=\aT(u-\uh,\xi - \vh) \text{ by Galerkin orthogonality for } u-\uh, \text{ for any } \vh \in \Vhp\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\NHokD{\xi-\vh}\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh} \wbaadj \NLtD{u-\uh}\nonumber.
\end{align}
Cancelling a factor of $\NLtD{u-\uh},$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:schatz1}
\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim \wbaadj \NHokD{u-\uh}.
\eeq
Combining \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:schatz1}, we have
\beqs
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\NHokD{u-\vh} + \mleft(k\wbaadj\mright)^2 \NHokD{u-\uh}^2,
\eeqs
and hence by cancelling a factor $\NHokD{u-\uh}$ and taking the final term on to the left-hand side, we obtain
\beqs
\NHokD{u-\uh} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NHokD{u-\vh} \tif k\wbaadj \text{ is sufficiently small}.
\eeqs
All results showing quasi-optimality for the Helmholtz equation (for different finite-element spaces and different domains) can then be seen as simply obtaining estimates on $\eta$ in these different scenarios; this literature is summarised in \cref{tab:qo,tab:acc,tab:dataacc} below.

\paragraph{Modified Schatz arguments} We now move on to compare and contrast the Schatz argument given above with elliptic-projection-modified-Schatz arguments. The main difference in the result of these arguments, compared to the Schatz argument given above, is that modified Schatz arguments only prove a \emph{bound} on the finite-element error, rather than proving quasi-optimality. However, these bounds are obtained under mesh restrictions that are \emph{less restrictive} than those required for quasi-optimality.

The elliptic projection of a function $ w \in \HozDD$ is the finite-element function $\Ph w$ that has the same action as $w$ on the finite-element space $\Vhp$ under some elliptic operator\footnote{The definition of the elliptic projection is dependent on the exact sesquilinear form used in the discretisation of the Helmholtz equation, and on the norm one is using to measure the error. For example, elliptic projection arguments originated in the study of discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Helmholtz equation (in \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11}); therefore the sesquilinear forms associated with the discretisation included penalty terms. These penalty terms were incorporated into the sesquilinear form $\aep$ and the norms used to measure the error also included these penalty terms. In the following exposition, we will work with standard finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation and standard Sobolev norms, and so the elliptic projections we used will be based on this setting.}; i.e., $\Ph w$ is defined by
\beqs
\aep(\vh,\Ph w) = \aep(\vh,w) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
\eeqs
for some sesquilinear form $\aep$, such that $\Ph$ is well-defined. For Helmholtz problems\footnote{Recall we are considering discretisations of \cref{prob:vtedp}, and therefore the sesquilinear form we use is given by \cref{eq:aT}.}, choices for $\aep(\vo,\vt)$ used in the literature are either
\beq\label{eq:aepho}
\aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt},
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:aeplower}
\aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt} + \IPLtD{\vo}{\vt},
\eeq
or
\beq\label{eq:aepused}
\aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt} - ik\IPLtGI{\vo}{\vt}.
\eeq
These elliptic projections correspond to finding finite-element approximations of the solution of the PDEs
\begin{align}
  \Delta w &= F \tin D,\label{eq:sd1}\\
  w &= 0 \ton \GD,\tand\label{eq:sd2}\\
  \dn w &= 0 \ton \GI\label{eq:sd3};
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \Delta w + w&= F \tin D,\label{eq:sd4}\\
  w &= 0 \ton \GD,\tand\label{eq:sd5}\\
  \dn w &= 0 \ton \GI;\label{eq:sd6}
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}
  \Delta w &= F \tin D,\label{eq:sd7}\\
  w &= 0 \ton \GD,\tand\label{eq:sd8}\\
  \dn w -ikw &= 0 \ton \GI\label{eq:sd9}
\end{align}
respectively, where $F$ is an appropriately chosen function. In the following exposition, we will assume $\aep$ is given by \cref{eq:aepused}.
Since $\Ph$ is a Galerkin projection, one can show that in its energy norm $\Nep{\cdot}$ (equivalent to the $k$-weighted $H^1$ norm $\NHokD{\cdot}$, with equivalence constants independent of $k$ via the multiplicative trace inequality and the Poincar\'e--Friedrich's inequality (\cref{lem:poincare} below) $\aep$ is coercive and continuous\footnote{For comment on showing coercivity and continuity for the other definitions of $\aep$, see \cref{rem:epdef} below.}, and hence is quasi-optimal:
\beq\label{eq:epho}
\Nep{w-\Ph w} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \Nep{w-\vh}.
\eeq
Also, by the Aubin--Nitsche duality argument (as $\aep$ is coercive),
\beq\label{eq:eplt}
\NLtD{w-\Ph w} \lesssim h \Nep{w-\Ph w}.
\eeq
\ednote{Euan---you said you wanted to have a discussion about what properties exactly are required for the elliptic projection---hopefully the exposition below is a starting point. I've gone with quasi-optimality for the time being, as it means one can see the analogues with the Schatz argument more clearly. But lets chat about this!}

Combining \cref{eq:epho,eq:eplt} is a modification of the Schatz argument above: We start from \cref{eq:schatz0}, but instead of introducing an arbitrary $\vh \in \Vhp$ into the second argument, we instead introduce the elliptic projection $\Ph \xi$ by Galerkin orthogonality for $u-\uh$:
\begin{align}
  \NLtD{u-\uh}^2 &= \aT(u-\uh,\xi-\Ph\xi)\nonumber\\
  &= \aep(u-\uh,\xi-\Ph\xi) - k^2\IPLtD{u-\uh}{\xi-\Ph\xi}\nonumber\\
  &= \aep(u-\Ih u,\xi-\Ph\xi) - k^2\IPLtD{u-\uh}{\xi-\Ph\xi} \text{ by Galerkin orthogonality for }\xi-\Ph\xi\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \wbaadj \NLtD{f} \wba \NLtD{u-\uh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh} \NLtD{\xi-\Ph\xi}\text{ by \cref{eq:epho}}\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \wba\wbaadj \NLtD{f}\NLtD{u-\uh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh} h\wba \NLtD{u-\uh}\text{ by \cref{eq:epho,eq:eplt}.}\label{eq:schatz2}
\end{align}
Therefore if $hk^2\wba$ is sufficiently small, the second term in \cref{eq:schatz2} can be absorbed into the left-hand side, and cancelling a factor of $\NLtD{u-\uh},$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:ep1}
k \NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim k \wba\wbaadj \NLtD{f} \tif hk^2\wba \text{ is sufficiently small,}
\eeq
this is \cref{eq:epbound}. (We consider $k\NLtD{u-\uh}$ so as to compare with the quasi-optimality results above, as the $L^2$ term in $\NHokD{\cdot}$ is also multiplied by a factor $k$.)

To obtain a bound on the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm\ednote{Both, Li and Wu \cite[Text after equation 4.15]{LiWu:18} use an error-spliiting-type technique to bound the $H^1$ error in terms of the $L^2$ error, but this only works because they're doing a PML problem, and so don't have a term defined on $\GI$. Would you mention this?}, we put \cref{eq:ep1} into \cref{eq:gardingerror} to get
\beqs
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\NHokD{u-\vh} + \mleft(k\wba\wbaadj\mright)^2 \NLtD{f}^2,
\eeqs
and taking $\vh = \Ih v,$ by \cref{lem:scottzhang} we have
\beqs
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \NHokD{u-\uh}\wba\NLtD{f} + \mleft(k\wba\wbaadj\mright)^2 \NLtD{f}^2,
\eeqs
We then obtain for any $\eps > 0$ by Cauchy's inequality \cref{eq:cauchy}
\beq\label{eq:ep2}
\NHokD{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \eps \NHokD{u-\uh}^2 + \frac1\eps\wba^2 \NLtD{f}^2 + \mleft(k\wba\wbaadj\mright)^2 \NLtD{f}^2.
\eeq
Taking $\eps$ sufficiently small, moving the first term on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:ep2} to the left-hand side, and taking a square root, we obtain
\beq\label{eq:ep3}
\NHokD{u-\uh} \lesssim\mleft(\wba  + k\wba\wbaadj\mright) \NLtD{f} \tif hk^2\wba\text{ is sufficiently small}.
\eeq

The term $\wba\NLtD{f}$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:ep3} is, up to a constant, the best-approximation error for $u$ (i.e., the error when one interpolates/quasi-interpolates $u$---see \cref{sec:helmfedisc,lem:scottzhang} above), and the term $k\wba^2$ is the \defn{pollution} term arising from the numerical method. As for the quasi-optimality results above, we remark that different bounds on the finite-element error (for different finite-element space $\Vhp$ and different domains) can be thought of as proving bounds on $\eta$ in these different situations.
\ednote{Both---I don't yet have a clear explanation of \emph{why} this works. Currently, it seems just like a trick to me. I don't know if that's an issue!}
\subsubsection{Error-splitting arguments}\label{sec:errorsplit}
The second class of arguments used in the literature are error-splitting arguments, used to prove accuracy and data-accuracy results. In these arguments the finite-element error is split using the elliptic projection of the solution $u$. To begin, we make the trivial observation that
\beqs\label{eq:split1}
u-\uh = \mleft(u-\Ph u\mright) + \mleft(\Ph u - \uh\mright).
\eeqs
Proving an error bound for $u-\uh$ therefore reduces to proving an error bound for the elliptic projection error $u- \Ph u$ and proving a bound on the difference $\Ph u - \uh.$ The former can either be accomplished by showing quasi-optimality of the elliptic projection (as above) or by proving such an error bound directly. The former approach is taken in \cite{DuWu:15,LiWu:18,ChGaNiTo:18}, and the latter approach is taken in \cite[Lemma 5.2]{FeWu:09} (althought the proof is only contained in \cite[Lemma 5.2]{FeWu:08}), \cite[Lemma 4.3]{FeWu:11}, and \cite[Lemma 4.2]{Wu:14}. In \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11,Wu:14} the bound on the elliptic projection error is proved by observing that the sesquilinear form $\IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt}$ is coercive on $\HozDD$, and then also controlling the additional term arising from the impedance boundary condition.

To bound the difference $\Ph u - \uh,$ one first shows that it solves a deterministic Helmholtz problem:
For $u-\uh,$ for any $\vh \in \Vhp$ we have $\aT(u-\uh,\vh) = 0$ and $\aep(u-\Ph u,\vh) = 0$ by Galerkin orthogonality for $u-\uh$ and $u-\Ph u$ respectively\footnote{For the arguments in this \namecref{sec:errorsplit}, we define the elliptic projection in the first argument, see \cref{eq:ellprojfirst} below.}. Therefore
\begin{align*}
  \aT(\Ph u - \uh,\vh) &= \aT(\Ph u - u,\vh) + \aT(u-\uh,\vh)\\
  &= \aT(\Ph u - u,\vh)\\
  &= \aep(\Ph u - u,\vh) - k^2\IPLtD{\Ph u - u}{\vh}\\
  &= - k^2\IPLtD{\Ph u - u}{\vh},
\end{align*}
that is, $\Ph u - \uh$ solves the \emph{discrete} Helmholtz problem
\beqs
\aT(\Ph u - \uh,\vh) = \IPLtD{\ftilde}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
\eeqs
where $\ftilde = k^2\mleft(u-\Ph u\mright).$ One then uses the fact that $\Ph u - \uh$ satisfies a discrete Helmholtz problem to prove a bound on the difference directly.

In \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11,Wu:14} a discrete multiplier argument is used to prove a bound on $\Ph u - \uh$, reminiscent of the multiplier arguments used to prove a priori bounds on Helmholtz problems in \cref{sec:pdetheory}. In \cite{DuWu:15} an argument using higher-order (discrete) norms is used in an argument conceptually similar to the modified duality arguments above; this argument is the heart of the proof in \cref{sec:fem} below. In essence the argument in \cite{DuWu:15} reduces to showing the bounds
\beq\label{eq:duwu1}
\NLtD{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim \mleft(h + \mleft(hk\mright)^p\mright)\NHokD{u-\Ph u} + \mleft(h^{p+1}k^2 + h^{2p}k^{p+2}\mright)\Nfn{p-1,h}{\Ph u - \uh}
\eeq
and
\beq\label{eq:duwu2}
\Nfn{p-1,h}{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim h^{2-p} \NHokD{u- \Ph u} + k^{p-1} \NLtD{\Ph u - \uh},
\eeq
where $\Nfn{p-1,h}{\cdot}$ is a discrete norm analagous to the Sobolev norm of order $p-1$. \Cref{eq:duwu1,eq:duwu2} are then combined to show
\beqs
\NLtD{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim \mleft(h + \mleft(hk\mright)^p\mright)\NHokD{u-\Ph u} + \mleft(\mleft(hk\mright)^{p+1} + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{\Ph u -\uh},
\eeqs
and the final term can be absorbed into the left-hand side if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small.

%\opntodo{For this section; for the first set you only need a bound on the elliptic projection error (with the right powers of $h$ and $k$). For the second one, We use quasi-optimality in $H^1$, the lower-order bounds in terms of the higher-order one, and a bound on the best approximation error. Maybe you could combine the first and third and get away with a bound on the elliptic projection error with the correct powers?}

Observe that when using the elliptic projection in such a splitting argument, there are two differences compared to the use of an elliptic projection in modified duality arguments:
\ben
\item One does not need the elliptic projection to be quasi-optimal \cref{eq:epho}, rather, one only need to bound the error $\NHokD{u-\Ph u}$, where $u$ solves a Helmholtz problem, in terms of $\NLtD{f}$.
\item The elliptic projection should be defined in the first argument, not the second, i.e.
  \beq\label{eq:ellprojfirst}
\aT(\Ph u,\vh) = \aT(u,\vh) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
  \eeq

%% \subsubsection{Complete technical overview of the literature}\label{sec:litsum}
%% We now give a brief overview of the literature on rigorous quasi-optimality/error bounds for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation, where the proofs use one of the techniques outlined above. We record this information tersely, having given more insight into the various techniques above. In the columns marked `mesh condition' the quantities listed must be sufficiently small, e.g., if `mesh condition' reads `$hk^2$' then the condition is `$hk^2$ sufficiently small'. If a quantity depends on $p$, but `$p$ fixed' is not specified, then the result holds for varying $p,$ i.e., for $hp$-finite-element methods. IF $p$ does not appear, then the results are for first-order finite-element methods only.

%%5 Can put the below somewhere %%

%% To keep the finite-element error bounded when solving \eqref{eq:introdet}, one must over-refine the numerical grid. That is, rather than using a fixed number of points per wavelength, one must increase the number of points per wavelength as $k$ increases. To achieve bounded finite-element error, one must refine the finite-element mesh size $h$ like $k^{-3/2}$. Whilst this result has been known numerically for some time, it was proven for \eqref{eq:introdet} only with constant coefficients (on various domains and for various finite-element spaces) in \cite{IhBa:95a,Wu:14,DuWu:15,ChNi:18}, and the first proof (to our knowledge) for \eqref{eq:introdet} with heterogeneous coefficients  is contained in \cref{chap:background}. Choosing $h \sim k^{-3/2}$ means \eqref{eq:intromat} is a linear system of size $k^{3d/2}$, larger than if one merely wants the interpolation error to be bounded. Hence, requiring a bounded finite-element error gives rise to very large linear systems.

%% More briefly, if one wants the finite-element solution to be quasi-optimal (that is, up to a constant, the finite-element solution is the best approximation in the finite-element space), then one must over-refine even more, and take $h \sim k^{-2}$. This mesh condition will give rise to linear systems with $k^{2d}$ degres of freedom. See \cref{chap:background} for further details on the necessity of this mesh condition, and further discussion of all the mesh conditions discussed above.\opntodo{EDIT THE ABOVE TO REMOVE `OVER-REFINE'}


%% \subsection{New error bounds for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media}\label{sec:heterr}
%% In this section, we prove that the finite-element approximation of the solution to the Helmholtz TEDP exists if $ h \lesssim k^{-3/2}.$ Moreover, we give an expression for the hidden constant that is completely explicit in $A$ and $n$, and we also prove a bound on the finite-element error, again completely explicit in $A$ and $n$. The argument in this section closely follows those in \cite{FeWu:11,ChNi:18} in its use of an elliptic projection argument to prove the required finite-element existence result and error bound. The paper \cite{FeWu:11} proved a similar result for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media, and \cite{ChNi:18} does so for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation with corner singularities.

%% Whilst we prove the results in this section for the TEDP, we expect that they can be extended to the Helmholtz Exterior Dirichlet Problem (EDP) where the infinite domain is truncated, and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is realised exactly on the truncated boundary. However, our proof below uses recently-proved bounds on the solution of a related problem to the TEDP from \cite{ChNiTo:18}; in order to extend our results to the EDP we would need analogues to the results in \cite{ChNiTo:18} for the EDP.

To avoid the complications stated above, and to allow us to use the results in \cite{ChNiTo:18}, we therefore impose the additional smoothness on $\gD.$ Also, in the case with $F$ only in $\HozDDprime$, proving a priori bounds on the solution of the TEDP is more complicated (c.f., e.g., \cite[Theorem 2.5]{GrPeSp:19} and \cite[Corollary 2.16]{GrPeSp:19} which consider the analogous EDP).

As $\NLtGI{v} = 0,$ it follows that $\trGI v =0,$ and hence by the trace theorem, as $v$ is constant, it follows that $v=0.$

\section{New Finite-Element-Error bounds for the Heterogeneous Helmholtz Equation}\label{sec:fem}

We now prove our new error bounds for higher-order finite-element approximations of the solution of the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media--- we show that (for nontrapping media) the finite-element method applied to \cref{prob:tedp} is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate. Our results are a generalisation of results proved by Du and Wu \cite{DuWu:15} for higher-order finite-element approximations of the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media; our results and proofs broadly follow those in \cite{DuWu:15}, with the main differences that:
\ben
\item We modify the proofs to cater for the heterogeneity of the coefficients, and
\item The dependence of our results on all of the constants involved is explicit.
\een
  In particular our results are explicit in $n$ and $k$ and are (in principle) explicit in $A$.

The proofs of our results have many parts, and appear technical, largely due to the burden of explicitly keeping track of all of the constants involved. However, in essence, the proof consists of two ideas:
\ben
\item Decompose the error $u-\uh = (u - \Ph u) + (\Ph u - \uh)$, where $\Ph u$ is an elliptic projection of $u$, and
\item Bound the error $u - \Ph u$ using the fact that $\Ph u$ is a Galerkin projection.
\item Bound the error $\Ph u - \uh$ in higher-order `discrete' norms, using the fact that $\Ph u - \uh$ solves a discrete Helmholtz problem.
\een

The structure of the remainder of this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} is as follows. In \cref{sec:errbounds} we state our new finite-element-error bounds. In \cref{sec:decomp} we prove a decomposition of the solution that allows us to prove a higher-order best approximation bound. In \cref{sec:anbackground} we collect together some routine analysis results needed for our proofs. In \cref{sec:errgalerkin} we prove error bounds for a number of different Galerkin projections (including the elliptic projection) that we use in subsequent proofs. In \cref{sec:discsob} we develop a notion of discrete derivatives and discrete norms, and prove properties of these norms. These norms will allow us to define higher-order discrete norms of functions in our finite-element space. Finally in \cref{sec:fembound} we prove our main finite-element error bounds.



\subsection{Main result: new finite-element-error bounds}\label{sec:errbounds}
As we are using higher-order finite elements (which we assume are of degree $p$), we will require extra smoothness assumptions on $A$, $n,$ and the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$. We also make simple assumptions on $k,$ $\nmin$, and $\NLiD{n}$ in order to simplify our calculations.
\bas[Assumptions for higher-$p$ finite-element method bounds]\label{ass:highp}
Assume
\bit
\item $\GD \neq \emptyset,$
\item $\GD$ and $\GI$ are $\Cpo$,
\item $\Aij \in \CpmooDclos$ for all $i,j$, and
\item $n \in \LiD \cap \HpmoD \cap \CfloordtD.$
%\item $f \in \HpmoD$
%  \item $\gI \in \HpmhGI$
  \eit
  \eas
  The assumption $\GD \neq \emptyset$ allows us to show the elliptic projection operator defined in \cref{eq:epdef} below is well-defined. The regularity assumptions on $\GD,$ $\GI$, and $A$ ensure that we can apply a shift theorem for a related stationary diffusion equation up to order $p-1$. The assumption on $n$ ensures that for all $m \in [0,p-1]$ and for all $v \in \HmD,$ $nv \in \HmD$ (see \cref{thm:banachalg} below). However, observe that we make no additional assumptions on the data $f$ and $\gI,$ and so the solution $u$ may not be smoother than $H^2.$

We make the following \lcnamecref{ass:htwo} on the solution of \cref{prob:vtedp}. Recall that the adjoint of \cref{prob:vtedp} is the same as \cref{prob:vtedp}, except \cref{eq:vtedp} is replaced by
\beq\label{eq:adjoint}
\aT(v,u) = \overline{\FT(v)} \tforall v \in \HozDDR.
\eeq

\bas\label{ass:htwo}
\Cref{prob:vtedp} (and its adjoint) has a unique solution $u$ in $\HtD$, and there exists $\CAnk>0$ (possibly dependent on $A$, $n,$ and $k$) such that
\beq\label{eq:generalhtwo}
k \NLtD{u} + \SNHoD{u} + \frac1k \SNHtD{u} \leq \CAnk \Cfg,
\eeq
where $\Cfg \de \NLtD{f} + \NLtGI{\gI}$.
\eas

Finally, we make the following \lcnamecref{ass:convenient} to simplify the proofs in this section. \Cref{ass:convenient} is by no means necessary, but greatly simplifies the proofs.

\bas[Assumptions for convenience of proofs]\label{ass:convenient}
Assume: $k \geq 1$, $\NLiD{n} \geq 1,$ $\nmin \leq 1$, $hk \leq 1$, and there exists $\Ctildemin > 0$ independent of $k$ such that $\CAnk k \geq \Ctildemin.$
\eas
%Note that one could require $\NHhGI{\gI}$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:generalhtwo} (as $\gI \in \HhGI$); however, since the bound in \cref{thm:tedp} only has $\NLtGI{\gI}$, we use the form \cref{eq:generalhtwo} to include \cref{thm:tedp}.

Throughout this \lcnamecref{sec:fem}, we adopt the following piece of notation.
\beqs
\nvar = \frac{\NLiD{n}}{\nmin},
\eeqs
%% and
%% \beqs
%% \En = \max\set{\frac{\NHsD{n}}{\nmin^2} \st s \in (d/2,p-1];\frac{\NWsiD{n}}{\nmin^2}\st s \in [2,d/2];1}\nvar.
%% \eeqs
%The quantity $\En$ arises from bounds on the `elliptic projection' mentioned above in weighted norms, see \cref{lem:ellprojerrw} below.

Our main \lcnamecref{thm:fembound} is the following \lcnamecref{thm:fembound}.
\bth[Higher-order error bound for the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation]\label{thm:fembound}
Let $u$ be the solution of \cref{prob:vtedp}. Under \cref{ass:highp,ass:htwo,ass:convenient}, there exist constants $\CFEMLt, \CFEMHo, \Chcond > 0$, independent of $h$, $k$ and $n$, such that if
\beq\label{eq:hfemcond}
h \leq \Chcond \Condn(n) \CAnk^{-\frac1{2p}}k^{-1-\frac1{2p}},
\eeq
then the finite-element solution $\uh$ exists, is unique, and satisfies the error bounds
\beq
\NLtD{u-\uh} \leq \CcorLt \CLtn(n)\mleft(h^2 + \CAnk^2 (hk)^{2p}\mright)\Cfg\tand\label{eq:femltbound}
\eeq
\beq
\NHokD{u-\uh} \leq \CcorHo \CHon(n)\mleft(h + \CAnk (hk)^p + \CAnk^2k (hk)^{2p}\mright)\Cfg,\label{eq:femhobound}
\eeq
where
\beqs
\Condn(n) = \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)^{-\frac1{p+1}}\mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)^{-\frac{p-1}{2p}},
\eeqs
\beqs
\CLtn(n) = \nvar^6\nmin^{-(p+1)} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\tand
\eeqs
\beqs
\CHon(n) = \mleft(1+\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)\CLtn,
\eeqs
where the polynomial $\Pfn(x)$ is defined in \cref{eq:p} below, and the $n$-dependent constant $\En$ is defined in \cref{eq:en} below.

The proof of \cref{thm:fembound} is on \cpageref{page:thmfembound} below.

\bco[$\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accuracy]
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound}, if $\CAnk \lesssim 1$ (i.e., \cref{prob:tedp} is nontrapping), then the finite-element method is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate (where the constants $\Co$ and $\Ct$ in \cref{def:hkdataacc} depend on $A$ and $n$).
\eco

Whilst the calculations in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} are explicit in all the constants involved, these dependencies are complex and, to a large extent, unnecessary to understand the flow of the arguments. Therefore, for ease of reference, the definition of all the constants in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} (which are many-layered and interdependent) are given in \cref{app:constants}; i.e., any constant introduced or defined in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} will be listed in \cref{app:constants}.



\subsubsection{Discussion of new finite-element-error bounds}

\bre[Relationship of new bounds to the work of Du and Wu]
In \cite{DuWu:15} Du and Wu proved that the error for high-order finite-element methods for the \emph{homogeneous} Helmholtz interior impedance problem is bounded provided $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small. Our proof follows theirs, and achieves analagous results---observe that the condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} requires $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ to be sufficiently small, where the `sufficient smallness' condition depends on $A$ and $n$. We note as above that our results and proof have the following modifications to those of Du and Wu (the modifications listed in order of their impact upon the proof).
\ben
\item We prove bounds for \emph{heterogeneous} $A$ and $n$; in particular, in several places in the proof we must work with $n$-weighted inner products and norms; see \cref{rem:why} for more details on why $n$-weighted inner products and norms are required.
\item We explicitly track all of the constants involved in the proof---our results are completely explicit in $n$, and are in theory explicit in $A$ (see \cref{rem:explicita} below for information on the explicitness in $A$).
\item We allow for the possibility that the Helmholtz problem is trapping---the constant $\CAnk$ appearing in \cref{eq:hfemcond} may depend on $k$ (as well as $A$ and $n$). If the Helmholtz problem was nontrapping, $\CAnk$ would be independent of $k$.
  \item We assume the existence of a Dirichlet scatterer $\Dm,$ as opposed to only considering the interior impedance problem, where $\Dm=\emptyset.$
\een
\ere

\bre[Why are the results not fully explicit in $A$?]\label{rem:explicita}
The condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} and the bounds \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound} are not fully explicit in $A$, i.e. the constants $\Ccond, \CcorLt,$ and $\CcorHo$ may depend on $A$. This dependence is because the constants in the shift theorem for the stationary diffusion equation (\cref{thm:shift} below) are not explicit in their $A$-dependence. In principle one can determine this dependence (it is determined for a right-hand side in $\LtD$ and a solution in $\HtD$ in \cite[Appendix A]{ChScTe:13}).
\ere
\bre[Why the appearance of $\nvar$?]\label{rem:nvar}
The quantity $\nvar = \NLiD{n}/\nmin$ appears in multiple places in the definition of the $n$-dependent constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n).$ This appearance is mainly due to the fact that in multiple places in the proof of \cref{thm:fembound}, we must convert from working in an $n$-weighted norm to a standard norm, and then later convert back to an $n$-weighted norm again.

This conversion is usually necessary because certain results (such as \cref{thm:shift,lem:poincare,thm:trace,thm:multiplicativetrace}) are only available in the literature in standard (non-$n$-weighted) norms, and so to apply these results we must first transfer to non-$n$-weighted norms, apply the results, and then tranfer back. If one could prove these results for $n$-weighted norms (under sufficient smoothness conditions on $n$) with constants that were completely explicit in $n$, then many of the instances of $\nvar$ could be removed.
\ere

\bre[Bounds not sharp in $n$]\label{rem:nsharp}
The $n$-dependence of the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ is almost certainly not sharp, because
\ben
\item The proof of \cref{thm:fembound} is complex, and involves recursively applying bounds on finite-element functions (as in, e.g., the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}, see \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum,eq:oddrecursive}). These arguments may well result in non-sharp $n$-dependence.
  \item As described in \cref{rem:nvar} above, many of the appearances of $\nvar$ in the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ is purely due to changing norms, then changing back, and so it is possible that the dependence of these constants on $\nvar$ (and therefore $n$) is not sharp.
\een
\ere

\bre[$p$-dependence]
To prove error bounds for $hp$-finite-element methods, one must know explicitly how the error bounds \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound} depend on $p$ as well as $h$ and $k$. Such an analysis was carried out for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11} and for the related time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in homogeneous media in \cite{MeSa:18}. In principle (as our results are explicit in all of the constants involved) one could calculate the $p$-dependence, however, such dependence is likely to be highly complicated, and may very well not be sharp, for similar reasons that the $n$-dependence of our results may not be sharp, as outlined in \cref{rem:nsharp} above.
\ere

\bre[Special cases of $n$]
In order to understand the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ it may be instructive to note their behaviour in the following three cases:
\bit
\item If $n=1,$ then $\Condn(n)=1, \CLtn(n)=1,$ and $\CHon(n)=2$.
\item If $\nmin$ is fixed, and $\NLiD{n} \rightarrow \infty,$ then $\Condn(n)\rightarrow 0,$ (i.e., the condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} becomes more restrictive), $\CLtn(n)\rightarrow \infty,$ and $\CHon(n)\rightarrow \infty$ (i.e., the right-hand side of the error bounds \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound} become larger).
\item If $\NLiD{n}$ is fixed, and $\nmin \rightarrow 0,$ then $\Condn(n)\rightarrow 0,$ $\CLtn(n)\rightarrow \infty,$ and $\CHon(n)\rightarrow \infty$ (i.e., the right-hand side of the error bounds \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound} become larger).
  \eit
  One can easily check each of these behaviours using the definition of $\nvar$, the definition of the constants $\Condn(n),$ $\CLtn(n)$, and $\CHon(n)$, and the definition of the polynomial $\Pfn{j}(x)$ in \cref{eq:p} below, and the definition of $\En$ in \cref{eq:en} below.
  \ere

  \bre[Extension to different boundary conditions on $\GI$]
  As in \cite[Remark 5.4(e)]{DuWu:15}, we remark that it is not obvious how to extend the proof of \cref{thm:fembound} to a Helmholtz problem with an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition on $\GI.$ In \cref{lem:higherbound,lem:ltthetahbound} below one must bound terms involving $\thetah$ on the truncation boundary $\GI$; these bounds are achieved using \cref{lem:boundarybound}, where we bound $\NLtGI{\thetah}$ by higher-order discrete norms of $\thetah$ and by the $k$-weighted $H^1$-norm of $\rho.$

  However, a crucial part of the proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound} is the fact that one has the bound $k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \lesssim \IPLtGI{\DtNapprox \thetah}{\thetah}$, where $\DtNapprox$ is the impedance approximation to the DtN map $\DtN,$ i.e., $\DtNapprox = ik.$ To replicate the proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound} for an exact DtN boundary condition, one would need to show $k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \lesssim \IPLtGI{\DtN \thetah}{\theta}$ for the \emph{exact} DtN map $\DtN.$ As mentioned in \cite[Remark 5.4(e)]{DuWu:15}, whether such a bound holds in general is an open question; such as bound has only been shown in \cite[Equation (3.4b)]{MeSa:10} for the case $\GI$ is a circle (in 2-d) or a sphere (in 3-d).
  \ere

\subsection{Decomposition of solution and best approximation bound}\label{sec:decomp}

For the first part of the proof of \cref{thm:fembound}, we prove a best approximation bound in $\Vhp$ for the solution of the Helmholtz equation following the presentation in \cite{ChNi:19} (although we explicitly keep track of the constants involved at each point). In order to obtain bounds for high $p$, we require the following shift \lcnamecref{thm:shift}:

\bth[Shift theorem]\label{thm:shift}
Under \cref{ass:highp}, for all integers $l \in \mleft[0,p-1\mright]$ there exists a constant $\CAl>0$ (depending on $A$) such that if $\ftilde \in \HlD$ and $\gItilde \in \HlphGI$, then there exists a unique $\utilde \in \HlptD$ such that $\utilde$ solves
\beq\label{eq:shifteq}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A \grad \utilde\mright) = -\ftilde,
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:shiftdbc}
\dn \utilde = \gItilde, \tand
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:shiftnbc}
\trD \utilde = 0
\eeq
and $\utilde$ satisfies the bound
\beq\label{eq:shift}
\NHlptD{\utilde} \leq \CAl \mleft(\NHlD{\ftilde} + \NHlphGI{\gItilde}\mright).
\eeq
\enth

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:shift}]
The uniqueness and existence of $\utilde$ (in $\HozDD$) follows from the Lax--Milgram theorem, as the variational formulation of \cref{eq:shifteq,eq:shiftdbc,eq:shiftnbc} is bounded and coercive. The proof for the higher regularity bounds uses standard elliptic regularity estimates in the interior and near the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$, and the work of the proof is combining these estimates. As a reference for these estimates we use \cite[pp. 137-138]{Mc:00}; \cref{ass:highp} means we can apply these estimates, as we have the necessary higher regularity of the coefficients and the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$.

To deal with the interior regularity and regularity near the boundary separately, we define the following subsets of $D$: $\Dint,\Dinttilde,\Dscat,$ and $\Dtrunc$ (see \cref{fig:shift-int,fig:shift-scat,fig:shift-trunc} for a schematic) with the following properties:
\bit
\item $\Dint \compcont \Dinttilde \compcont D$,
\item $\GD \subset \Dscatclos$
\item $\dist(\Dscat,\GI) > 0 $
  \item $\GI \subset \Dtruncclos$
\item $\dist(\Dtrunc,\GD) > 0 $

\caption{A schematic of the set $\Dtrunc$ from the proof of \cref{thm:shift}.}\label{fig:shift-trunc}

\end{figure}

    First applying interior regularity \cite[Theorem 4.16]{Mc:00} in $\Dinttilde,$ we obtain the bound
    \beq\label{eq:shiftint}
\NHlptDint{\utilde} \leq \CintAl \mleft(\NHoDinttilde{\utilde} + \NHlDinttilde{\ftilde}\mright).
\eeq
Applying regularity up to the boundary for Dirichlet data \cite[Theorem 4.18 (i)]{Mc:00} in $\Dscat,$ we obtain (as $\trD \utilde = 0$)
\beq\label{eq:shiftscat}
\NHlptDscat{\utilde} \leq \CscatAl \mleft(\NHoD{\utilde} + \NHlD{\ftilde}\mright)
\eeq
and similarly for Neumann data \cite[Theorem 4.18 (ii)]{Mc:00} in $\Dtrunc,$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:shifttrunc}
\NHlptDtrunc{\utilde} \leq \CtruncAl \mleft(\NHoD{\utilde} + \NHlphGI{\dn \utilde} + \NHlD{\ftilde}\mright).
\eeq
Combining \cref{eq:shiftint,eq:shiftscat,eq:shifttrunc}, we obtain \cref{eq:shift}.
\epf




%% The following trace theorem is standard, see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 3.37]{Mc:00}.


The following \lcnamecref{lem:domainshift} follows from \cref{thm:shift}.

\bco\label{lem:domainshift}
Under \cref{ass:highp}, let $\ftilde \in \HlD$ and $\gtilde \in \HlpoD,$ for $0 \leq l \leq p-1$. If $\utilde \in \HlptD$ solves
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \utilde\mright) = -\ftilde,
\eeqs
\beqs \trGD u = 0,
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\dn u = \trGI \gtilde,
\eeqs
then
\beqs
\NHlptD{\utilde} \leq \CAl\mleft(1+\CTrlpo\mright)\mleft(\NHlD{\ftilde} + \NHlpoD{\trGI \gtilde}\mright).
\eeqs
\eco

The proof of \cref{lem:domainshift} requires the Trace theorem.

\bth[Trace Theorem]\label{thm:trace}
If $v \in \HmD,$ for $1/2 < m \leq p+1$, then there exists $\CTrm > 0$ independent of $v$ such that
\beqs
\NHmmhGI{\trI v} \leq \CTrm \NHmD{v}.

\enth

For a proof of \cref{thm:trace}, see \cite[Theorem 3.37]{Mc:00}

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:domainshift}]
By \cref{thm:shift,thm:trace}
\beqs
\NHlptD{\utilde} \leq \CAl \mleft(\NHlD{\ftilde} + \NHlphGI{\gtilde}\mright) \leq \CAl \mleft(\NHlD{\ftilde} + \CTrfn{l}\NHlpoD{\gtilde}\mright),
\eeqs
and the result follows.

We are now able to prove the following \lcnamecref{thm:expansion} that gives a decomposition of the solution $u$ of \cref{prob:vtedp} into lower-order, less oscillatory parts $\uj$ and a smoother, more-oscillatory part $\uosc$. The main advantage of this \lcnamecref{thm:expansion} is that it enables us to prove a higher-order best-approximation bound (\cref{lem:bestapprox} below) for solutions of the Helmholtz equation, \emph{even though} the solutions do not have high regularity.

\bth[Expansion of the solution of the Helmholtz equation]\label{thm:expansion}

\bre[How oscillatory are the functions in \cref{thm:expansion}?]\label{rem:osc}
Recall that a higher power of $k$ appearing in an a priori bound indicates that a function is more oscillatory. In \cref{eq:expansionuj} below, the $(j+2)$th-order norm of $\usj$ is of order $k^j$ (i.e., the power of $k$ is \emph{two} orders of magnitude less than the order of the norm) whereas in \cref{eq:expansionuosc} the $(p+1)$st-order norm of $\uosc$ is of order $k^p$ (the power of $k$ is \emph{one} order of mangitude less that the order of the norm). Therefore, in this sense, $\uosc$ is `more oscillatory' than $\usj.$
\ere

\Cref{thm:expansion} is essentially just \cite[Theorem 1]{ChNi:19} in the particular case of a Helmholtz problem, but with the dependence on all the constants kept track of. The results in \cite{ChNi:19} are stated for a wider class of time-harmonic wave propagation problems, but the dependence on all of the constants is not made explicit.

We also point out (as in \cite[Section 7]{ChNi:19}) that \cref{thm:expansion} is reminiscent of results by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}who show, for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation that the solution $u$ can be decomposed as $u = \uHt + \uA,$ where $\uHt \in \HtD$ but is not oscillatory ($\NHtD{\uHt} \lesssim 1$), and $\uA$ is analytic but $\uA$ is oscillatory ($\NHmD{\uA} \lesssim k^{m-2}$ for all $m$)\footnote{These results are proved with no obstacle and $f$ given by a Dirac delta function in \cite[Lemma 3.5]{MeSa:10} and for: (i) the IIP with a bounded Lipschitz boundary that is either a 2-d polygon or analytic, or (ii) the EDP with an analytic scatterer, in \cite[Theorems 4.10, 4.20]{MeSa:11} respectively. In the former case the proof is under an assumption of a polynomial growth of the a priori bound \cite[Assumption 4.8]{MeSa:11}, i.e., $\CAnk$ is a polynomial in $k$.}. This decomposition is used in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11} to prove convergence results for $hp$-finite element methods for the Helmholtz equation. %We note that the results in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} could, in principle, be used in the analysis of $hp$-methods, as it is, in principle, possible to track the dependence of the constants on the polynomial degree $p.$

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:expansion}]
The idea of the proof is as follows. We write $u$ as a formal series expansion
\beq\label{eq:formalseries}
u = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \usj,
\eeq
and then substitute this series into the PDE \cref{eq:tedp} and the boundary condition \eqref{eq:ibc}. Equating powers of $k$, we derive a recursive sequence of stationary diffusion equations for the functions $\usj,$ with right-hand sides dependent on $\ujmo$ and $\ujmt$. We use this recursive sequence and \cref{lem:domainshift} to prove the a priori bounds \cref{eq:expansionuj}.

We then define the $l$th remainder $\rl = u - \sum_{j=0}^{l-1} \usj,$ and by applying the operator $\grad\cdot\mleft(A\grad \cdot\mright)$ with Neumann boundary conditions to $\rl$, we obtain a recursive sequence for the remainders $\rl,$ and can similarly prove a priori bounds for the functions $\rl$. The oscillatory function $\uosc$ is then just $\rpmo.$ The format of this proof is identical to that in \cite[Theorem 1]{ChNi:19}, except we keep track of all of the constants involved.

For the purposes of the proof, it is more convenient to define $\vj = \usj/k^j,$ so that the series expansion \cref{eq:formalseries} becomes\footnote{In \cite{ChNi:19} the notation is changed slighty, and the series expansion is defined as $u = \sum_{j=0}^\infty k^j \uj,$ i.e., the functions $\vj$ in our proof are denoted $\uj$ in \cite{ChNi:19}.}
\beq\label{eq:formalseriesv}
u = \sum_{j=0}^\infty k^j\vj
\eeq
as in \cite{ChNi:19}. Also, in this proof, all the boundary-value problems involve included a zero Dirichlet condition on the scatterer $\GD;$ we omit this boundary condition throughout the proof for brevity.

By applying the Helmholtz operator to the formal series \eqref{eq:formalseriesv} we obtain the following equations for $\vj \in \HjptD, j \geq 1$:
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vz\mright) = -f \quad\tand\quad \dn \vz = \gI,
\eeqs
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vo\mright) = 0\quad\tand\quad\dn \vo = i\vz,
\eeqs
and
\beq\label{eq:vj}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vj\mright) = - n\vjmt\quad\tand\quad\dn \vz = i\vjmo \quad\tfor j \in \mleft[2,p-2\mright].
\eeq

By \cref{thm:shift} we immediately conclude the bound
\beq\label{eq:expuz}
\NHtD{\vz} \leq \CAz\Cfg \leq \Cefn{0}\Cfg,
\eeq
i.e., \cref{eq:expansionuj} for $j=0.$ By \cref{lem:domainshift,eq:expuz} we can conclude the bound
\beqs
\NHthD{\vo} \leq \CAo \mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)\NHtD{i\vz} \leq \max\set{1,\CAo}\mleft(1+\CTrfn{2}\mright)\Cefn{0} \Cfg = \Cefn{1}\Cfg,
\eeqs
i.e., \cref{eq:expansionuj} for $j=1$.

We prove the bound \cref{eq:expansionuj} for higher $j$ by induction. Let $j \in \mleft[2,p-2\mright]$ and suppose \cref{eq:expansionuj} holds for all $s \in [0,j-1].$ Using \cref{lem:domainshift}, we conclude that (using the observation that $\Cefn{j-1} = 2\max\set{1,\CAjmo}\mleft(1+\CTrj\mright)\Cefn{j-2}\geq \Cefn{j-2}$)
\begin{align*}
\NHfn{j+2}{D}{\vj} &\leq \CAj \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\mleft(\NLiD{n} \NHfn{j}{D}{\vfn{j-2}} + \NHfn{j+1}{D}{\vfn{j-1}}\mright)\\
&\leq \max\set{1,\CAj} \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\mleft(\NLiD{n} \Cefn{j-2} \Pfn{j-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright) + \Cefn{j-1} \Pfn{j-1}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mright)\Cfg\\
&\leq 2\max\set{1,\CAj} \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\Cefn{j-1} \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n})\Cfg\\
&= \Cefn{j} \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n})\Cfg.
\end{align*}
%% Therefore the definition of the polynomials $\Pj$ \cref{eq:pjdef} holds (and it is straightforward to see that $\deg\mleft(\Pj\mright) = \deg\mleft(\Pfn{j-2}\mright)+1$, where $\deg$ denotes polynomial degree, and therefore since $\deg\mleft(\Pfn{0}\mright) = \deg\mleft(\Pfn{1}\mright)=0,$ \cref{eq:polydegree} holds. Hence, by the relationship between $\usj$ and $\vj$, we have the bound \cref{eq:expansionuj}.

We will now define the remainders $\rl$, and proceed similarly.
Let $\ro \in \HthD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \ro\mright) = -k^2 u \tand \dn \ro = ik\trGI u.
\eeqs
Then by \cref{lem:domainshift}
\beqs%gin{align*}
\NHthD{\ro} \leq \CAo\mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)\mleft(k^2\NHoD{u} + k\NHtD{u}\mright)\leq \CAo\mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)k^2\CAnk\Cfg\leq \frac{\Cefn{1}}{\max\set{1,\CAz}}k^2\CAnk \Cfg
\eeqs%nd{align*}
by definition of $\Cefn{1}$.
Let $\rt \in \HfD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \rt\mright) = -k^2 u \tand \dn \rt = ik\trGI \ro.
\eeqs
Then by \cref{lem:domainshift}
\begin{align*}
\NHfD{\rt} &\leq \CAt\mleft(1+\CTrth\mright)\mleft(k^2\NHtD{u} + k\NHthD{\ro}\mright)\\
&\leq \CAt\mleft(1+\CTrth\mright)\mleft(1 + \frac{\Cefn{1}}{\max\set{1,\CAz}}\mright)\CAnk k^3\Cfg\\
&\leq 2\CAt\mleft(1+\CTrth\mright)\frac{\Cefn{1}}{\max\set{1,\CAz}}\CAnk k^3 \Cfg\text{ as } \Cefn{1} \geq 1,\\
&\leq \frac{\Cefn{2}}{\max\set{1,\CAz}}\CAnk k^3\Cfg.
\end{align*}
Then for $j \geq 3,$ let $\rj \in \HjptD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \rt\mright) = -k^2 \rjmt \tand \dn \rj = ik\trGI\rjmo.
\eeqs
And by induction and \cref{lem:domainshift} again, letting $\uosc = \rfn{p-1},$ we have \cref{eq:expansionuosc}. It is straightforward to see that $\rfn{p-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{p-2} \uj$ solves \cref{prob:tedp}, and therefore \cref{eq:expansionid} holds, as $u$ is unique.
\epf
%\{Just a note while I think about it - could you do DtN boundary conditions in this proof by testing with a different function when wanting to bound the $L^2$ norm on the boundary? I wonder if testing with the NtD of $u$ would mean you end up with a $\LtGI{u}^2$ term, and then you could use properties of the NtD map to bound other bits. Might foil $k$-dependency though.}
Using the expansion in \cref{thm:expansion}, we can prove the following error bound for the best approximation of $u$ in $\Vhp$:

%% We also have the following best-approximation error in higer-order Sobolev spaces:
%% \ble[Best approximation in $\HmD$]\label{lem:bestapproxhigh}

%% \eeqs
%% \ele

\ble[Best approximation error bound]\label{lem:bestapprox}
Under \cref{ass:highp,ass:htwo}, there exist constants $\CFEMo, \CFEMt > 0$ independent of $k$ and $n$ (although dependent on $A$ and $p$) such that if $u$ solves \cref{prob:vtedp} or its adjoint, then there exists $\uhhat \in \Vhp$ such that
\beq\label{eq:bestapproxL2}
\NLtD{u-\uhhat} \leq \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMo  h^2 + \CFEMt \CAnk h\mleft(hk\mright)^p \mright)\Cfg,
\eeq
%% \beq\label{eq:bestapproxH1}
%% \NHoD{u-\uhhat} \leq \mleft(\CFEMo h + \CFEMt \CAnk \mleft(hk\mright)^p \mright)\Cfg \tand
%% \eeq
\beq\label{eq:bestapproxW}
\NHokD{u-\uhhat} \leq 2\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMo  h + \CFEMt \CAnk \mleft(hk\mright)^p \mright)\Cfg.
\eeq
\ele

%We write bounds for the standard and weighted $H^1$ norms separately, as we will use each individual bound in differents of proofs in \cref{sec:fembound}.

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:bestapprox}]
We apply \cref{lem:scottzhang} to all the $\usj$ and $\uosc$ in \cref{thm:expansion}, and obtain that there exist $\ujh \in \Vhp$ $j=0,\ldots,p-2$ and $\uosch \in\Vhp$ such that 
\beqs
\NLtD{\usj - \ujh} + h\NHoD{\usj - \ujh} \leq \Cinterpfn{j+2} \Cefn{j} \Pj\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright) h^{j+2}k^j \Cfg

\beqs
\NLtD{\uosc - \uosch} + h\NHoD{\uosc - \uosch} \leq \Cinterpfn{p+1} \Cosc\CAnk h^{p+1}k^p \Cfg.
\eeqs
Therefore, by letting $\uhhat = \uosch + \sum_{j=0}^{p-2} \ujh,$ we have \cref{eq:bestapproxL2,eq:bestapproxW} (using the facts that $hk \leq 1$ and $\Pfn{p-2}(\NLiD{n}) \geq \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n}) \geq 1$ for all $j \leq p-2$ since $\NLiD{n} \geq 1$).

\subsection{Error bounds for Galerkin projections}\label{sec:errgalerkin}
In this \lcnamecref{sec:errgalerkin} we state a sequence of error bounds in negative Sobolev norms for two different projection operators. The proofs of these error bounds are all simple modifications of the standard duality-argument proofs of finite-element errors in negative Sobolev norms, as in, e.g., \cite[Theorem 5.8.3]{BrSc:08}.
%\ednote{Both-should I write out at least one of these modified proofs?}. % Note to self, I have these proofs sketched out, but just use the argument from Brenner and Scott and use an L^2 inner product on the function, not their gradients, for the elliptic projection.
We first define the projections we use.

Define the elliptic projection $\Ph:\HozDD\rightarrow\Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
\beq\label{eq:epdef}
\aep(\Ph w,\vh) = \aep(w,\vh) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
  \eeq
  where
  \beq\label{eq:aepdef}
  \aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt}.
  \eeq
%% and define the weighted elliptic projection $\Phn:\HozDD\rightarrow\Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
%% \beqs
%% \IPLtD{A\grad\vh}{\grad\Phn w} = \IPLtDn{A\grad\vh}{\grad w} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
%% \eeqs
  Observe that $\Ph w$ is the finite-element approximation of the solution of the stationary diffusion problem with `diffusion coefficient' $A$ and right-hand side in $\HozDD'$ given by $\aep(w,\cdot).$
  
%% We define the $\LtD$-projection $\Qh:\HozDD\rightarrow \Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
%% \beqs
%% \IPLtD{\Qh w}{\vh} = \IPLtD{w}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
%% \eeqs
Define the $\LtD$ projection in the $n$-weighted norm $\Qhn:\HozDD\rightarrow \Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
\beqs
\IPLtDn{\Qhn w}{\vh} = \IPLtDn{w}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
\eeqs

where, for $v,w \in \LtD,$ $\IPLtDn{v}{w}$ is the $n$-weighted inner product
\beqs
\IPLtDn{v}{w} \de \int_{D} n v \wbar.
\eeqs

We also define the corresponding $n$-weighted $\LtD$ norm $\NLtDn{v} = \sqrt{\int_{D} n \abs{v}^2}$ and for $m \in \NN$, the $n$-weighted $\HmD$ norms
\beqs
\NHmDn{v}^2 \de \sum_{\alpha \st \abs{\alpha} \leq s}\NLtDn{D^\alpha v},
\eeqs
and the negative $n$-weighted Sobolev norms
\beq\label{eq:negweightnorm}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{v} \de \sup_{w \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{v}{w}}{\NHmDn{w}}.
\eeq

Observe that, for $v \in \HmD,$
\beq\label{eq:nconv}
\nmin\NHmD{v} \leq \NHmDn{v} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHmD{v}.
\eeq
%We put the \emph{non-weighted} $H^s$-norm in the denominator of \cref{eq:negweightnorm}, but the \emph{weighted} inner product in the numerator for ease of manipulation in some of the following proofs---we could place the weighted $H^s$ norm in the denominator, and this would be equivalent to the current definition, up to a factor involving $n$.
%% so that we have, for all $v \in \LtD$
%% \beq\label{eq:neqweightid}
%% \NHmsD{n v} = \NHmsDn{v}.
%% \eeq
%% \beq\label{eq:negativeweightbounds}
%% \frac{\NHmsD{v}}{\NLiD{n}} \leq \NHmsDn{v} \leq \frac{NHmsD{v}}{\nmin}.
%% \eeq

The proofs of the error bounds for the Galerkin projections will use the following notation for the solution operator of a particular stationary diffusion problem. We let $\DeltaAI:\LtD\rightarrow\HtD$ denote the solution operator for the following stationary diffusion equation: given $\ftilde \in \LtD$ find $\utilde \in \HtD$ such that
\beq\label{eq:sdeq}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \utilde\mright) = -n\ftilde \text{ in } D
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:sddbc}
\trD \utilde = 0
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:sdnbc}
\dn \utilde = 0.
\eeq
%% $A$-weighted Laplacian; that is $\DeltaA w = \grad\cdot\mleft(\grad w\mright),$ and give it domain $\DomainDeltaA = \set{w \in \HtD \st \trD w = 0, \dn w = 0};$
%% hence $\DeltaA:\DomainDeltaA \rightarrow \LtD.$ Observe that, for any $f \in \LtD$ there exists $\wf \in \DomainDeltaA$ such that $\DeltaA \wf = -f.$
For the reason there is a factor $n$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq}, see \cref{rem:why} below. Observe that $\sdsol$ is well-defined by \cref{thm:shift} as $n \ftilde \in \LtD$. Also, observe that $\sdsol^{m}$ is well-defined for any $m \in \NN,$ as $\HtD \subseteq \LtD,$ and so one can place $\sdsol \ftilde$ on the right-hand side. 
For any $\ftilde \in \LtD$ and for any $v \in \HozDD,$ we have, by Green's identity,
\beqs
\int_D \mleft(A \grad \mleft(\DeltaAI\ftilde\mright)\mright)\cdot \grad \vb = \int_D n\ftilde \vb,
\eeqs
i.e.,
\beq\label{eq:deltaagreen}
\IPLtD{A\grad \mleft(\sdsol \ftilde\mright)}{\grad v} = \IPLtDn{\ftilde}{v}.
\eeq




We now state and prove error bounds for the two projections given above. As stated above, the proofs below are all modifications of the standard proof (in, e.g., \cite[Theorem 5.8.3]{BrSc:08}). We can, in essence, use the standard proof because all the projections defined above are Galerkin projections given by coercive and bounded sesquilinear forms on $\HoD$ (for $\Ph$) or $\LtD$ (for $\Qhn$).

\ble[Existence and uniqueness of Galerkin projections]\label{lem:eugp}
For any $w \in \HozDD$ the elliptic projection $\Ph w$ and the $n$-weighted $L^2$ projection $\Qhn w$ exist and are unique.
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:eugp}]
The existence and uniqueness of $\Ph w$ and $\Qhn w$ follows from the Lax--Milgram Theorem (see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 2.7.7]{BrSc:08}) applied in $\Vhp$ (as in, e.g., \cite[Corollary 2.7.13]{BrSc:08}), because $\Ph w$ and $\Qhn w$ are defined by sesquilinear forms that are continuous and coercive on $\HozDD$ (equipped with the $k$-weighted $H^1$ norm $\NHokD{\cdot}$) and $\LtD$ respectively.

Continuity and coercivity are immediate in the case of the $n$-weighted $L^2$ projection $\Qhn.$ For the elliptic projection $\Ph,$ continuity is immediate, and coercivity follows from the Poincar\'e inequality \cref{eq:poincare}, because we work in $\HozDD,$ and so all the functions we consider vanish on $\GD.$

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:ellprojerrw}]
For the case $m \geq 1$, let $\phi \in \HmD,$ and observe that by \cref{ass:highp,thm:banachalg} $n\phi\in \HmD$. Let $ \vtilde = \sdsol(\phi)$ and observe $\vtilde \in \Hfn{}{m+2}{D}$ by \cref{thm:shift}. Observe that for all $v \in \HozDD,$ by definition of $\vtilde$ and the $n$-weighted inner product $\IPLtDn{\cdot}{\cdot}$, we have
\beq\label{eq:vtilde}
\IPLtD{A \grad v}{\grad \vtilde} = \IPLtD{nv}{\phi} = \IPLtDn{v}{\phi}
\eeq
(where we multiply the complex conjugate of \cref{eq:sdeq} by $v$, and integrate by parts).
Taking $v = w-\Ph w$ in \cref{eq:vtilde}, we have
\begin{align}
\IPLtDn{v}{\phi} &= \IPLtD{A\grad\mleft(w-\Ph w\mright)}{\grad\mleft(v - \Ih v\mright)} \text{by Galerkin orthogonality for } \Ph\nonumber\\
&\leq \CSZfn{m+2}\NLiDop{A} \NHfn{m+2}{D}{\vtilde} h^{m+1} \SNHoD{w-\Ph w} \text{ by \cref{lem:scottzhang}}\nonumber\\

\end{align}

For $m > d/2$ by \cref{thm:banachalg,eq:nconv} \cref{eq:ellprojwpart} is bounded above by
\beq\label{eq:wep1pt0}
\CSZfn{m+2} \CAfn{m} \CBanfn{m} \NLiDop{A} \frac{\NHfn{m}{D}{n}}{\nmin}\NHnfn{m}{D}{\phi} h^{m+1}\SNHoD{w-\Ph w}.
\eeq


Therefore we have, by definition of $\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\cdot}$ and $\NHoDn{\cdot}$,
\beq\label{eq:wep1pt1}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{w-\Ph w} \leq \CSZfn{m+2}\CAfn{m} \CBanfn{m} \NLiDop{A} \frac{\NHmD{n}}{\nmin^2} h^{m+1} \NHoDn{w - \Ph w}.
\eeq
Applying C\'ea's Lemma to $\Ph$ in the $n$-weighted $H^1$ norm, we find
\beq\label{eq:wepcea}
\NHoDn{w-\Ph w} \leq \frac{2\NLiDop{A}}{\min\set{1,1/\CP^2}\Amin}\nvar\BAHoDn{w}{\wh},
\eeq
as $\Ph$ corresponds to a sesquilinear form with continuity constant $\NLiDop{A}/\nmin$ and coercivity constant
\beqs
\mleft(\Amin\min\set{1,1/\CP}\mright)/\mleft(2\NLiD{n}\mright).
\eeqs
Combining \cref{eq:wep1pt1,eq:wepcea}, we obtain \cref{eq:errn} in the case $m > d/2$.

For $m \in [1,d/2],$ \cref{thm:banachalg} yields, instead of \cref{eq:wep1pt0},
\beq\label{eq:wep2pt1}
2\CSZfn{m+2} \CAfn{m} \Cprod{m} \NLiDop{A} \frac{\NWmiD{n}}{\nmin}\NHnfn{m}{D}{\phi} h^{m+1}\SNHoD{w-\Ph w},
\eeq
(since $1 + \NWmiD{n} \leq 2\NWmiD{n},$ as $\NLiD{n} \geq 1$) and by a similar reasoning to that before, we obtain \cref{eq:errn}, in the case $m \in [1,d/2]$.

For the case $m=0$, using \cref{lem:ellprojerr} and then converting to the $n$-weighted $L^2$ norm yields \cref{eq:errn}. For $m=-1$, \cref{eq:wepcea} immediately gives \cref{eq:errn}.

\bre[Subtleties regarding $\Ph$ for the IIP]\label{rem:epdef}
If we consider the IIP (i.e., we remove the assumption $\GD \neq \emptyset$ in \cref{ass:highp}), then we can no longer prove \nameCrefs{lem:eugp} \ref{lem:eugp}, \ref{lem:ellprojerr}, or \ref{lem:ellprojerrw}, because the sesquilinear form $\aep$ is no longer coercive on $\HozDD$. (Note $\HozDD = \HoD$ in this case.)

This lack of coercivity stems from the fact that we cannot apply the Poincar\'e inequality \cref{eq:poincare} to functions in $\HoD,$ because such functions are no longer zero on a portion of $\d D$ with non-zero $d-1$-dimensional measure. (Recall \cref{lem:poincare} requires such a property.) One can alternatively view this problem as arising from the fact that the stationary diffusion equation with Neumann boundary conditions does not have a unique solution (as one can simply add a constant to any solution). In the case $\GD=\emptyset,$ the PDE corresponding to the elliptic projection is precisely such a stationary diffusion equation: \cref{eq:sd1,eq:sd3} (\cref{eq:sd2} does not apply, as $\GD = \emptyset$).

The remedy for this lack of coercivity/lack of uniqueness is to change the sesquilinear form $\aep$ from \cref{eq:aepho} to either \cref{eq:aeplower} or \cref{eq:aepused}. This change corresponds to changing the PDE underlying the elliptic projection from \cref{eq:sd1,eq:sd3} to either \cref{eq:sd4,eq:sd6} or \cref{eq:sd7,eq:sd9} respectively. Either of these alternatives for $\aep$ is coercive in the $k$-weighted $H^1$ norm, and so the proof of \cref{lem:eugp} goes through as before.

However, if one defines $\aep$ using \cref{eq:aepused}, then one encounters the additional problem that one does not have a shift theorem (analagous to \cref{thm:shift}) for the underlying PDE \cref{eq:sd7,eq:sd9}. Such a shift theorem is used in the proof of \cref{lem:ellprojerr,lem:ellprojerrw} to prove bounds in negative-order norms. Whilst one could rewrite \cref{eq:sd7,eq:sd9} as
\beqs
\Delta w = F  \tin D \tand
\eeqs
\beqs
\dn w = ikw \ton \GI
\eeqs
and then use \cref{thm:shift} to obtain results analagous to \cref{thm:shift}, the constants in the resulting bounds \cref{eq:shift} would be \emph{$k$-dependent}. This $k$-dependence would mean the resulting proof of $\hka{(2p+1)/(wp)}$-data-accuracy would not work. Whilst a shift theorem for \cref{eq:sd7,eq:sd9} that \emph{is} $k$-independent has been proved by Chaumont-Frelet, Nicaise, and Tomezyk \cite[Theorems 3.1, 4.3, and 5.1]{ChNiTo:18}, this is a lowest-order shift theorem (i.e., the analogue of \cref{thm:shift} for $l=0$) and no mention is made in \cite{ChNiTo:18} of an extension to higher order.

Therefore, if one wishes to prove results for higher-order finite elements, the only reasonable course of action when considering the IIP is to use \cref{eq:aeplower} to define $\aep$. In this case one can then repeat the proof of \cref{thm:shift} almost verbatim (as the results from \cite{Mc:00} used in the proof of \cref{thm:shift} also hold for the PDE \cref{eq:sd4,eq:sd6}), and the proofs of \cref{lem:ellprojerr,lem:ellprojerrw} proceed as before. However, observe that this course of action works fr our proof because our proof technique (error splitting) allows us to bound terms arising on the truncation boundary $\GI$ (see \cref{lem:boundarybound} below). However, if one uses a modified Schatz technique, it is not clear to us how one would bound terms arising on the truncation boundary. Therefore, these terms on the tunrcation boundary must be incorporated into the elliptic projection, and so one must use \cref{eq:aepused} to define the elliptic projection. One must then accept that, with current technology, one will be limited to proving bounds for first-order methods, due to the lack of a shift theorem for the underlying PDE, as outlined above. (We note in passing that it was precisely this usage of an elliptic projection given by \cref{eq:aepused} by Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise in \cite{ChNi:18} that led to the work \cite{ChNiTo:18}.)

\subsection{Discrete Sobolev spaces}\label{sec:discsob}
When we analyse the high-order finite-element method, we need to measure higher-order norms of functions in the finite-element space $\Vhp.$ However, as these functions do not have higher-order weak derivatives, we must first define a notion of higher-order discrete derivatives, and then develop some theory of so-called discrete Sobolev spaces. We follow the presentation in \cite{DuWu:15}, albeit working in the heterogeneous case, and with some changes of notation. The main result of this \lcnamecref{sec:discsob} is \cref{lem:negdiscsum} below giving the relationship between negative-order discrete Sobolev norms and negative-order continuous Sobolev norms.

To our knowledge, \cite{DuWu:15} is the only place in the literature where the above construction of higher-order discrete norms appears, although Thom\'{e}e defines these norms for negative integers $m$ in \cite[Equation above Lemma 1]{Th:80}. However, the idea of using a self-adjoint, coercive operator to define a norm can be found in, e.g., \cite[Section 2.1]{LiMa:72}, and the authors also observe \cite[Text at the bottom of page 9]{LiMa:72} that one can use a spectral decomposition to define arbitrary powers of such operators (analagous to \cref{def:hodd}). See \cite[Section 2.1]{BaKuMa:19} for a simpler exposition of defining a (fractional-order) Sobolev norm via an operator.

We observe in passing that \cref{def:hodd} is analagous to the spectral definition of the fractional Laplacian $\mleft(-\Delta\mright)^m$; see the recent review article \cite[Section 2.5.1]{LiPaGuSoGlZhMaCaMeAiKa:18} for an overview of this idea.

We will use the following \lcnamecref{lem:intoip} to bound the inner product of two discrete functions by their negative- and positive-higher-order discrete norms, or to transfer discrete derivatives from one argument of the inner product to the other.

\ble[Introduction of derivatives into inner product]\label{lem:intoip}
%% For $m \in \RR,$ $v \in \LtD$, and $w \in \LtD\cap\Domain{\DeltaA^{m/2}}$ we have
%% \beqs

For $\vh, \wh \in \Vhp,$ and $m \in \RR$ we have
\beq\label{eq:feipsplit}
\IPLtDn{\vh}{\wh} = \IPLtDn{\Deltahmmt \vh}{\Deltahmt \wh} 
\eeq
and
\beq\label{eq:feiptrans}
\IPLtDn{\Deltah^m \vh}{\vh} = \IPLtDn{\Deltahmt \vh}{\Deltahmt \vh}.
\eeq
\ele
\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:intoip}]
We only prove \cref{eq:feipsplit}, as the proof of \cref{eq:feiptrans} is analagous. Since $\vh,\wh \in \Vhp,$ there exist sequences $(\aj)_{j =1,\ldots,\dimVhp}$ and $(\bsl)_{l =1,\ldots,\dimVhp}$ such that $\vh = \sum_{j=1}^{\dimVhp} \aj\phij$ and $\wh = \sum_{l=1}^{\dimVhp} \bsl \phil.$ Then we have
\begin{align*}
\IPLtDn{\Deltahmmt \vh}{\Deltahmt \wh} &= \int_D n\mleft(\sum_{j=1}^{\dimVhp}\lambdaj^{-m/2} \aj\phij\mright)\overline{\mleft(\sum_{l=1}^{\dimVhp} \lambdal^{m/2}\bsl \phil\mright)}\\
&= \sum_{j,l=1}^{\dimVhp} \lambdaj^{-m/2} \lambdal^{m/2} \aj \bsl \int_D n \phij \philbar\quad \text{ as the } \lambdaj \text{ are real}\\
& =\sum_{j}^{\dimVhp} \aj \bsj \int_D n\abs{\phij}^2\quad \text{ as the } \phij \text{ are orthonormal}\\
&= \IPLtDn{\vh}{\wh},
\end{align*}
where the final line follows by repeating the above process in reverse without the factors $\lambdaj^{-m/2}$ and $\lambdal^{m/2}$.

We recall the standard inverse inequality for finite-element functions, so that we can prove an analagous inverse inequality for discrete norms.

\ble[Standard inverse inequality]\label{lem:inverseinequality}

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:inversediscrete}]
We only prove the case $m=1,$ as the other cases will follow immediately. We have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{1,h,n}{\vh}^2 &= \IPLtDn{\Deltahh \vh}{\Deltahh \vh}\\
&= \IPLtDn{\Deltah \vh}{\vh} \text{ by \cref{eq:feiptrans}}\\

by the standard inverse estimate, and the result follows as $\Nzhn{\cdot} = \NLtDn{\cdot}$.

For $m \neq 1$ we have
\begin{align*}
  \Nmhn{\vh} &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{\frac{m}2}\vh}\\
  &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{\half}\mleft(\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2}\vh\mright)}\\

  &\leq \Chinv \frac{1}{\nmin} h^{-1} \Nzhn{\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2}\vh}\\

by the result for $m=1,$ and the result for $m\neq 1$ follows.

To prove \cref{lem:negdiscsum} below we require the following \lcnamecref{lem:shiftnegativew} giving the shift theorem in negative $n$-weighted norms.

\ble[Shift theorem in negative $n$-weighted norms]\label{lem:shiftnegativew}
Let $\ftilde \in \LtD$ a d $m \in [0,p-1]$ be an integer. Under \cref{ass:highp} we have
\beq\label{eq:shiftnegativew}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\sdsol\ftilde} \leq \Cshiftfn{m} \shiftn{m} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde},

\end{dcases}
\eeqs
\ele
We define
\beqs
\Rn = \max_{m = -1,\ldots,p-1}\set{\shiftn{m}}.
\eeqs

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}]
We first observe that the operator $\sdsolo$ is self-adjoint on $\LtD$. Let $\DeltaA:\HtD\rightarrow\LtD$ denote the stationary diffusion operator $\grad\cdot\mleft(A\grad\cdot\mright)$ with no boundary conditions applied. Then for any $\vo \in \LtD,$
\beq\label{eq:scomp}
\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vo = \vo.
\eeq
Moreover, by Green's Theorem, $\DeltaA$ is self-adjoint on the set $\set{v \in \HtD \st v \text{ satisfies \cref{eq:sddbc,eq:sdnbc}}},$ this set contains the image of $\sdsolo.$ Therefore, for any $\vo,\vt \in \LtD,$ we have
\beq\label{eq:solosa}
\IPLtD{\sdsolo \vo}{\vt} =\IPLtD{\sdsolo \vo}{\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vt} = \IPLtD{\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vo}{\sdsolo \vt} = \IPLtD{\vo}{\sdsolo \vt},
\eeq
using \cref{eq:scomp} and the fact that $\DeltaA$ is self adjoint. I.e., \cref{eq:solosa} shows $\sdsolo$ is self-adjoint on $\LtD.$

Observe that by \cref{thm:banachalg}, if $v \in \HmD$ then $nv \in \HmD,$ and therefore by \cref{thm:shift} $\sdsolo(nv) \in \HmptD.$ With these facts in place we can compute
\begin{align*}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\sdsol \ftilde} &= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{\sdsol \ftilde}{nv}}{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{\sdsolo\mleft(n \ftilde\mright)}{nv}}{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{\ftilde}{\sdsolo\mleft(n v\mright)}}{\NHmDn{v}}\quad\tas \sdsolo \text{ is self-adjoint}\\
&\leq \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}\NHnfn{m+2}{D}{\sdsolo\mleft(nv\mright)} }{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&\leq \sup_{v \in \HmD}  \frac{\CAfn{m} \NLiD{n} \NHmD{nv} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}}{\NHmDn{v}}
%% & = \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{ n\ftilde}{\sdsol(v)}}{\NHmD{v}}\text{ by definition of } \sdsol, \text{ and as } \sdsolo \text{ is self-adjoint}\\
%% &= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{\ftilde}{\frac{\sdsol(nv)}n}}{\NHmD{v}}\\
%% &\leq \CBanfn{m+2}\sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\NHfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}\NHfn{m+2}{D}{\sdsol(nv)}\NHfn{m+2}{D}{\frac1n}}{\NHmD{v}} \text{ by \cref{thm:banachalg}}\\
%% &\leq \CBanfn{m+2}\CAfn{m}\sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\NHfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}\NHfn{m}{D}{nv}\NHfn{m+2}{D}{\frac1n}}{\NHmD{v}} \text{ by \cref{thm:shift}}\\
\end{align*}
and by applying \cref{thm:banachalg} to the term $\NHfn{m}{D}{nv}$ (or observing that $\NLtD{nv} \leq \NLiD{n}\NLtD{v}$ in the case $m=0$), the result follows, except for $m=-1.$

For $m=-1,$ we have, by the Lax--Milgram Theorem in non-weighted norms,
\beqs
\NHoD{\Sn \ftilde} \leq \NHmoD{n\ftilde}/\Amin.
\eeqs
One can straightforwardly show that
\beqs
\NHnfn{1}{D}{\Sn \ftilde} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHoD{\Sn \ftilde}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\NHmoD{n\ftilde} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHnfn{-1}{D}{\ftilde},

and so the result follows.

\ble[Relationship between discrete and continuous negative-order norms]\label{lem:negdiscsum}
Under \cref{ass:highp}, for any integer $j \in [0,p+1],$ there exists a constant $\Csumj > 0$ such that for all $\vh \in \Vhp,$

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}]
Let $\wh \in \Vhp,$ and define $\zh = \DeltahI \wh$ and $z = \DeltaAI \wh$ (observe $z$ is well-defined as $\Vhp \subseteq \LtD$). Then, for all $\vh \in \Vhp$, we have

\begin{align*}
\IPLtD{A \grad z}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtD{A \grad \mleft(\sdsol \wh\mright)}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtDn{\wh}{\vh},\quad \text{and}\\
\IPLtD{A \grad \zh}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtDn{\Deltah \zh}{\vh} = \IPLtDn{\wh}{\vh},
\end{align*}
where the equalities in the first line follow from the definition of $z$ and \cref{eq:deltaagreen}, and the equalities in the second line follows from \cref{eq:discderdef} and the definition of $\zh.$  Therefore (using the fact that $A$ is symmetric), for all $\vh \in \Vhp,$ $\IPLtD{A\grad z}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtD{A\grad \zh}{\grad \vh},$ i.e., $\zh = \Ph z.$

We now have, for $m \in [-1,p-1]$
\begin{align}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\DeltahI \wh} &\leq \NHnfn{-m}{D}{z} + \NHnfn{-m}{D}{z-\zh}\nonumber\\
&\leq \NHnfn{-m}{D}{z} + \Cwfn{-m}  \CAfn{0} \CSZfn{2} \errn{m} \NLiD{n} h^{m+2} \NLtD{\wh}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw,lem:scottzhang,thm:shift}, as }\zh = \Ph z\nonumber\\
&= \Cshiftfn{m} \shiftn{m} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\wh} + \Cm \errn{m} \frac{\NLiD{n}}{\nmin} h^{m+2} \NLtDn{\wh}\label{eq:sumforrecursion}
\end{align}
by \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}.
From \cref{eq:sumforrecursion}, we can conclude that, for $l \in \NN$ and $\vh \in \Vhp$, writing $\wh = \Deltahmlpo \vh$,
\beq\label{eq:lrecursion}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\Deltahml \vh} \leq \Cshiftfn{m}\shiftn{m} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\Deltahmlpo \vh} + \Cm \errn{m} \frac{\NLiD{n}}{\nmin} h^{m+2} \NLtDn{\Deltahmlpo \vh}
\eeq
as $\Deltahml = \DeltahI \Deltahmlpo$. We now use \cref{eq:lrecursion} recursively to bound $\Nfn{j,h,n}{\vh}$.

If $j = 2l,$ then one can show inductively using \cref{eq:lrecursion} that for any integer $t \in [0,l]$
\beq\label{eq:evenrecursivesum}
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} \leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^t\sum_{m=0}^t \Efn{m,t} h^{2m} \NHDfn{-2(t-m)}{\vh} ,
\eeq
where we define the constants $\Efn{m,t}$ inductively by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Emt1}\Efn{0,0} &=1,\\
\label{eq:Emt2}\Efn{m,t} &= \Cshiftfn{2(t-1-m)} \Efn{m,t-1} \tfor 0 \leq m \leq t-1, \quad\tand\\
\label{eq:Emt3}\Efn{t,t} &= \sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Csumrecfn{2(t-1-m)} \Efn{m,t-1}.
\end{align}
To see this recurrence, we prove the inductive step: suppose
\beqs
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} \leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{t-1}\sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Efn{m,t-1} h^{2m} \NHDfn{-2(t-1-m)}{\vh}.
\eeqs
Then using \cref{eq:lrecursion}, we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} &\leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{t-1}\sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Efn{m,t-1} h^{2m} \mleft(\Cshiftfn{2(t-1-m)}\shiftn{2(t-1-m)} \NHnfn{-(2(t-1-m)+2}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t} \vh}\mright.\\
&\quad\quad\mleft.+ \Csumrecfn{2(t-1-m)} \errn{2(t-1-m)} \nvar h^{2(t-1-m)+2} \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-l+t} \vh}\mright),
\end{align*}
which upon rearranging, and using the fact that $\shiftn{2(t-1-m)} \leq \errn{2(t-1-m)}$ and $\nvar \geq 1,$ yields \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum}, with the recurrence \cref{eq:Emt1,eq:Emt2,eq:Emt3}.

If $j=2l+1,$ then we first reduce $\Nfn{-j,h}{\vh}$ to a point analagous to the even case, and then proceed as before. Let $\wh$ and $\zh$ be as at the beginning of the proof, and let $z$ solve the variational formulation\footnote{We use the variational formulation here, as we will need to bound the $H^1$-norm of $z$ by the $H^{-1}$-norm of $\wh$, which is immediate from the Lax--Milgram theorem.}  of \cref{eq:sdeq,eq:sddbc,eq:sdnbc} with $\ftilde = \wh$. Observe that we still have $\zh = \Ph z,$ and

\beq\label{eq:LMHmo}
\NHfn{1}{D}{z} \leq \frac1{\Amin} \NHfn{-1}{D}{n\wh}
\eeq
by the Lax--Milgram Theorem. Then
\begin{align}
\NLtDn{\Deltah^{-1/2}\wh} &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{1/2} \zh}\nonumber\\
&= \IPLtDn{\Deltah \zh}{\zh} \text{ by \cref{eq:feiptrans}}\\
&= \IPLtD{A \grad \zh}{\grad \zh}\nonumber\\
&= \NLiDop{A} \NHoD{\Ph z}\nonumber\text{ by the Cauchy--Schwartz inequality and the definition of } \zh\\

\end{align}
We now return to $\Njhn{\vh}$:
\begin{align*}
  \Nfn{j,h,n}{\vh} &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-l-1/2} \vh}\\
  &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-1/2} \Deltah^{-l} \vh}\\
&\leq \frac{\mleft(1+\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\NLiDop{A}}{\Amin}\NLiD{n}\NHnfn{-1}{D}{\Deltah^{-l}\vh}
\end{align*}
by \cref{eq:deltahhalf}.

Similarly to \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum}, one can use \cref{eq:lrecursion} recursively to show that, for any integer $t \in [0,l]$
\beq\label{eq:oddrecursive}
\NHnfn{-1}{D}{\Deltah^{-l}\vh} \leq \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^t\mleft(\Etildefn{0,t} \NHnfn{-(2t+1)}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t}\vh} + \sum_{m=0}^t \Etildefn{m,t} h^{2m+1}  \NHnfn{-2(t-m)}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t}\vh}\mright),
\eeq
where  we define the $\Etildefn{m,t}$ inductively for $t \in [0,l]$ by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Etilde1}\Etildefn{0,0} &= 1,\\
%\label{eq:Etilde2}\Etildefn{1,1} &= \Csumrecfn{1}\\
\label{eq:Etilde3}\Etildefn{0,t} &= \Etildefn{0,t-1}\Cshiftfn{2(t-1)+1)},\\
\label{eq:Etilde4}\Etildefn{m,t} &= \Etildefn{m,t-1}\Cshiftfn{2(t-1-m)}\tfor m = 1,\ldots,t-1,\quad\text{and}\\
\label{eq:Etilde5}\Etildefn{t,t} &= \Csumrecfn{2(t-1)+1} + \sum_{m=0}^{t-1}\Etildefn{m,t-1}\Csumrecfn{2(t-1-m)}.
\end{align}
To show \cref{eq:oddrecursive,eq:Etilde1,eq:Etilde3,eq:Etilde4,eq:Etilde5}, observe that \cref{eq:Etilde1} is immediate. We show \cref{eq:oddrecursive,eq:Etilde3,eq:Etilde4,eq:Etilde5} by induction. Suppose %\cref{eq:oddrecursive} holds for $t-1,$ then
\begin{align*}
  \NHnfn{-1}{D}{\Deltah^{-l}\vh} \leq \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{t-1}&\Bigg(\Etildefn{0,t-1} \NHnfn{-(2(t-1)+1)}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t-1}\vh}\\
& \quad + \sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Etildefn{m,t-1} h^{2m+1}  \NHnfn{-2(t-1-m)}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t-1}\vh}\Bigg).

Then

\end{align}
and rearranging \cref{eq:verylongeq}, and using the facts that $\shiftn{m} \leq \errn{m}$ for all $m$ and $\nvar \geq 1,$ we obtain \cref{eq:oddrecursive} with the constants $\Etildefn{m,t}$ given by \cref{eq:Etilde1,eq:Etilde3,eq:Etilde4,eq:Etilde5}. Therefore, we conclude that if $j = 2l+1$
\begin{align}
\Nfn{-j,h,n}{\vh} \leq& \frac{\mleft(1+\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\NLiDop{A}}{\Amin}\NLiD{n}\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{l}\mleft(\Etildefn{0,l} \NHnfn{-(2l+1)}{D}{\vh}\mright.\nonumber\\

\bre[Why is the factor $n$ only on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq}?]\label{rem:why}
The reason for defining $\Sn$ with a factor $n$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq} but not on the left-hand side is somewhat buried in the proof of \cref{thm:fembound} and its associated lemmas. However, we give an overview of the reason here.

All the bounds in the proofs of \cref{lem:boundarybound,lem:higherbound,lem:ltthetahbound} are in $n$-weighted discrete norms, because to prove bounds on the $n$-weighted $L^2$ projection $\Qhn$ we work in $n$-weighted higher-order discrete norms (as in \cref{lem:wltdprojerr}), rather than in non-weighted norms. Because we only work in $n$-weighted norms, we need \cref{lem:intoip} below to hold in the \emph{$n$-weighted} inner product. To prove \cref{lem:intoip} in the $n$-weighted inner product, we therefore use the $n$-weighted inner product on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:discderdef}, where the $\Deltah$ operator appears. Because we use the $n$-weighted inner product on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:discderdef}, we must then use the $n$-weighted inner product on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:deltaagreen}. Using this inner product in \cref{eq:deltaagreen} ensures the beginning of the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum} works---see the proof for more details.

We do not, however, put a factor $n$ on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq,eq:deltaagreen}. If we did, when we apply \cref{thm:shift} to $\Sn \ftilde$ (as we do in \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}), the resulting bounds would not be fully explicit in $n$ (because in \cref{thm:shift} we do not know explicitly how the constants depend on the `diffusion coefficient'). Not putting a factor $n$ on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq} is the reason why there is a \emph{non-weighted} inner product on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:discderdef} (so that the beginning of the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}, as mentioned above, works).

\subsection{Proof of \cref{thm:fembound}}\label{sec:fembound}

Having established the necessary preliminary results about discrete Sobolev spaces, we are now in a position to prove our main theorem, \cref{thm:fembound}, which we do via a series of lemmas. The proof proceeds via a splitting argument, as discussed in \cref{sec:errorsplit}.

For ease of notation in the following lemmas, we follow the notation of \cite{DuWu:15} and let 
\beqs
\rho \de u - \Ph u, \tand
\eeqs
\beqs
\thetah \de \Ph u - \uh.
\eeqs


The following \lcnamecref{lem:simpleform} shows that $\thetah$ solves a discrete Helmholtz problem with data $k^2 \rho$ (in $D$) and $ik \rho$ (on $\GI$).
\ble[$\thetah$ solves a discrete Helmholtz problem]\label{lem:simpleform}
For any $\vh \in \Vhp,$
\beq\label{eq:thetaform}
\aT(\thetah,\vh) = k^2\IPLtDn{\Qhn\rho}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.
\eeq
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:simpleform}]
Let $\vh \in \Vhp.$ Then $\aT(\thetah,\vh) = \aT(u-\uh,\vh) - \aT(\rho,\vh) = -\aT(\rho,\vh)$ by Galerkin orthogonality. By definition of $a,$ we have $-\aT(\rho,\vh) = -\IPLtD{A\grad\rho}{\vh} + k^2 \IPLtD{n\rho}{\vh} + ik\IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.$ By Galerkin orthogonality for $\rho = u - \Ph u$, $\IPLtD{A\grad\rho}{\vh} = 0$, and so by the definition of the $n$-weighted $L^2$ inner product, and the $n$-weighted $L^2$-projection $\Qhn,$ the result follows.
\epf

As mentioned in \cref{rem:epdef}, the definition of the elliptic projection $\Ph$ (\cref{eq:epdef,eq:aepdef} above) uses a Neumann boundary condition on $\GI$, rather than an impedance boundary condition, and therefore the right-hand side of \cref{eq:thetaform} includes a term defined on the truncation boundary $\GI.$ If the definition of the elliptic projection used an imepdance boundary condition, this term would disappear. The presence of this term means that when we bound $\NLtDn{\thetah}$ and $\Npmohn{\thetah}$ in the proofs of \cref{lem:higherbound,lem:ltthetahbound} below, we will encounter terms involving $\NLtGI{\thetah}$. Therefore, we first prove a bound on $\NLtGI{\thetah}.$

\ble[Bound on $\NLtGI{\thetah}$ by $\Npmoh{\thetah}$]\label{lem:boundarybound}
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound}, we have
\beq\label{eq:boundarybound}
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq \Cboundaryo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{2\mleft(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1\mright)}\NLiD{n}^4 k^2 h^{2p-1} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2 + \Cboundaryt h \NHokD{\rho}^2,
\eeq
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound}]
In \cref{eq:thetaform}, let $\vh = \thetah,$ and take the imaginary part to obtain
\beq\label{eq:boundboundarybelow}
-k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq \Im k^2 \IPLtDn{\Qhn \rho}{\thetah} + \Re k \IPLtGI{\rho}{\thetah}.
\eeq
Therefore by \cref{cor:ipdiscbound}
\beq
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq  k \Nfn{1-p,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah}.\label{eq:thetaboundarypart}
%% \nonumber\\
%% &\leq  k \NLiD{n}^2 \Nfn{1-p,h}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{p-1,h}{\thetah} + \NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah}
\eeq
We first bound the negative norm $\Nfn{1-p,h}{\Qhn\rho}$, to do this we use \cref{lem:negdiscsum}. However, as we will apply \cref{lem:negdiscsum} we need to estimate negative (standard) Sobolev norms of $\Qhn\rho$; for integers $m \in [0,p-1]$ we have (observing that $\Qhn \Ph u = \Ph u$ as $\Ph u \in \Vhp$).
\begin{align}
\NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn\rho} &\leq \NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn u - u} + \NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{u - \Ph u}\nonumber\\
&\leq \CSZfn{(p-1-m)} \nvar h^{(p-1-m)} \NLtDn{u-\Ph u}\nonumber\\
&\quad+ \Cwfn{-(p-1-m)}\errn{(p-1-m)} h^{p-m} \NHoDn{u - \Ph u}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw,lem:wltdprojerr}, taking } \wh = \Ph u \text{ in \cref{lem:ellprojerrw,eq:wltdprojerr},}\nonumber\\
&\leq \mleft(\CSZfn{(p-1-m)} \Cwz + \Cwfn{-(p-1-m)}\mright)\En\nvar\NLiD{n} h^{p-m} \NHokD{\rho}\label{eq:Qhnrhoneg}
\end{align}
by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw}. By \cref{lem:negdiscsum,eq:Qhnrhoneg} we have
\begin{align}
\Nfn{1-p,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}&\leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}}\NLiD{n} \Csumfn{p-1} \sum_{m=0}^{p-1} h^{m} \NHfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn \rho} \nonumber\\
&\leq \Cmess \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \NHokD{\rho}.\label{eq:Qhnrhosum}
\end{align}
To bound $\NLtGI{\rho}$appearing in  the second term on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:thetaboundarypart} we use \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:ellprojerr}. We take $\wh = \Ph u$ in \cref{eq:ellprojerr} and use the fact that $\NHoD{\cdot} \leq \NHokD{\cdot}$ to obtain
\beq\label{eq:rhomtbound}
\NLtGI{\rho} \leq \CMT\NHoD{\rho}^{1/2}\NLtD{\rho}^{1/2} \leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^\half \NHoD{\rho}\leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^{\half} \NHokD{\rho}.
\eeq
Therefore by \cref{eq:rhomtbound} and Young's inequality \cref{eq:young}, we obtain
\beq\label{eq:rhothetamt}
\NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah} \leq \half \CMT^2 \Cprojfn{0} h \NHokD{\rho}^2 + \half \NLtGI{\thetah}^2.
\eeq
By combining \cref{eq:thetaboundarypart,eq:Qhnrhosum,eq:rhothetamt} we have
\begin{align}
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 &\leq k \Cmess \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \NHokD{\rho}\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad+ \half \CMT^2 \Cprojfn{0} h\NHokD{\rho}^2 + \half \NLtGI{\thetah}^2.\label{eq:thetahboundnear}
\end{align}
By using Young's inequality on the first term in \cref{eq:thetahboundnear}, and moving the $\NLtGI{\thetah}^2/2$ term onto the left-hand side, we obtain \cref{eq:boundarybound}.
\epf

We can now prove the main two \lcnamecrefs{lem:ltthetahbound} in the proof of \cref{thm:fembound}.

\ble[Bound on higher-order discrete norms of $\thetah$ by $\NLtD{\thetah}$]\label{lem:higherbound}
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound}, for integer $m \in [1,p-1]$ there exist constants $\Chighmo,$ $\Chighmt > 0$ such that
\begin{align}
\Nfn{m,h,n}{\thetah} &\leq \Chighmo \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)^mk^m \NLtD{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ \Chighmt \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho}.\label{eq:chigh}
\end{align}
\ele
\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:higherbound}]
By inserting the definitions of $a$ and $\Deltah$ into \cref{eq:thetaform} and rearranging, we have for any $\vh \in \Vhp$
\beqs
\IPLtDn{\Deltah \thetah}{\vh} = k^2 \IPLtDn{\thetah}{\vh} + k^2\IPLtDn{\Qhn \rho}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\thetah}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.
\eeqs
Therefore, if we take $\vh = \Deltah^{m-1}\thetah$, by \cref{lem:intoip} we have
\beq\label{eq:deltahm}
\Nfn{m,h,n}{\thetah}^2 = k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2 + k^2 \IPLtDn{\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2} \Qhn \rho}{\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2}\thetah} + ik\IPLtGI{\thetah}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah}.
\eeq
We now proceed to bound the two terms in \cref{eq:deltahm} defined on the truncation boundary $\GI.$ For the first term, we have
\begin{align}
\IPLtGI{\thetah}{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah} &\leq \NLtGI{\thetah}\NLtGI{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \NLtGI{\thetah} h^{-\half} \NLtD{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:inverseinequality}}\nonumber\\
&= \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} h^{-\half}\NLtGI{\thetah}\nmin^{-1}\Nfn{2m-2,h,n}{\thetah}\text{ by the definition of }\Nfn{2m-2,h,n}{\cdot},\nonumber\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1} h^{-m+\half} \nmin^{-m} \NLtGI{\thetah}\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:inversediscrete} applied } m-1 \text{ times,}\label{eq:useitagain}\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1} h^{-m+\half} \nmin^{-m}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\mleft(\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 k h^{p-\half} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \Cboundaryt^{\half} h^{\half} \NHokD{\rho}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:boundarybound} and \cref{eq:simple}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \bigg(\CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p}k \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\quad+ \CBt \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho}\bigg)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\label{eq:firstboundary}
\end{align}
by \cref{lem:inversediscrete} applied $p-m$ times.

To bound the second boundary term in \cref{eq:deltahm}, we have
\beq\label{eq:secondboundarytemp}
\IPLtGI{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah} \leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1}\nmin^{-m}h^{\half-m}\NLtGI{\rho}\Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}
\eeq
using the same reasoning as we used to obtain \cref{eq:useitagain} above. By \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:ellprojerr} (with $\wh = \Ph u$) we have
\beq\label{eq:secondboundarytemp2}
\NLtGI{\rho} \leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^{\half} \NHokD{\rho}.
\eeq

Inserting \cref{eq:secondboundarytemp2} into \cref{eq:secondboundarytemp} we obtain
\beq\label{eq:secondboundary}
\IPLtD{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah} \leq \CBth \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho} \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}.
\eeq

Therefore, from\renewcommand{\creflastconjunction}{,~} \cref{eq:deltahm,eq:firstboundary,eq:secondboundary},\renewcommand{\creflastconjunction}{\lastconj} and the Cauchy--Schwartz inequality, we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah}^2 &\leq k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}^2 + k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ k\mleft(\CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p}k \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \CBt \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ k\CBth \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho} \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}%\label{eq:thetahighnearlynearly}.
\end{align*}
Therefore using Young's inequality \cref{eq:young} we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah}^2 &\leq k^2\mleft(\frac32 + \CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p} + \half \CBt \nmin^{-m} + \half\CBth \nmin^{-m}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2\\
&\quad\quad+ \frac{k^2}2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}^2 +  h^{2(1-m)} \NHokD{\rho}^2,
\end{align*}
and by \cref{eq:simple}
\begin{align}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah} &\leq k\mleft(\sqrt{\frac32} + \CBo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2} + \frac1{\sqrt{2}} \CBt^{\half} \nmin^{-\frac{m}2} + \frac1{\sqrt{2}}\CBth^{\half} \nmin^{-\frac{m}2}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ \frac{k}{\sqrt{2}} \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho} +  h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho},\label{eq:thetahighnearly}
\end{align}

We now proceed to bound $\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}$: By \cref{lem:inversediscrete} we have
\begin{align}
  \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho} &\leq\Chinv^{m-1} \nmin^{1-m}h^{1-m} \NLtDn{\Qhn\rho}\nonumber\\
  &\leq \Chinv^{m-1} \nmin^{1-m}h^{1-m} \mleft(\NLtDn{\Qhn u - u} + \NLtDn{u-\Ph u}\mright)\label{eq:qhnmmo}
\end{align}
as in the proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound} using the fact that $\Qhn \Ph u = \Ph u.$

Using \cref{lem:wltdprojerr} we can bound the first of these terms by the second:
\beq\label{eq:firsttermbound}
\NLtDn{\Qhn u - u} \leq \CSZfn{0} \nvar \NLtDn{u-\Ph u}.
\eeq
We can also bound
\beq\label{eq:secondtermbound}
\NLtDn{u - \Ph u} \leq \Cwfn{0} \nvar^3h \NHnfn{1}{D}{\rho} \leq \Cwfn{0} \nvar^3\NLiD{n} h \NHokD{\rho}
\eeq
by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw}. Therefore by \cref{eq:qhnmmo,eq:firsttermbound,eq:secondtermbound} we have (as $kh \leq 1$ and $\nvar \geq 1$)
\beq\label{eq:qhnnearly}
k \Nfn{m-1,h}{\Qhn \rho} \leq \Chinv^{m-1}\Cwz \mleft(1+\CSZfn{0}\mright)\nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m}\NHokD{\rho}.
\eeq
Therefore using \cref{eq:thetahighnearly,eq:qhnnearly} (and the fact that $\NLiD{n}, \nmin^{-1} \geq 1,$ and so $\En, \nvar \geq1$)  we obtain

\begin{align}
  \Nfn{m,h}{\thetah} &\leq \CRecofn{m} \mleft(1+\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)k \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
  &\quad+ \CRect \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m} \NHokD{\rho}.\label{eq:readytorecurse}
\end{align}
Using \cref{eq:readytorecurse} recursively, and the facts that $\nmin^{-1} \geq 1$ and $hk \leq 1,$ we obtain \cref{eq:chigh}.
\epf

The following \lcnamecref{lem:continuity} is straightforward to prove, and used in the proof of \cref{lem:ltthetahbound} below
\ble[Continuity of $a$]\label{lem:continuity}

\beqs
\abs{\aT(\vo,\vt)} \leq \Cc \NLiD{n} \NHokD{\vo}\NHokD{\vt}.

\ble[Bound on $\NLtDn{\thetah}$ by $\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}$]\label{lem:ltthetahbound}
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound},%there exist constants $\Cfirst, \Csecond > 0$ such that
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}&\leq \mleft(\Cfirst\NHokD{\rho} +\Csecond  k^2h^p\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\mright)\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nonumber\\

\end{align}
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:ltthetahbound}]
The proof initially uses the standard duality technique, but then becomes more complex than standard proofs. This complexity is due to the fact that (i) we are bounding $\thetah$, not the finite-element error $u-\uh$, and (ii) we are bounding $\thetah$ by its higher-order-discrete norms, rather than by its $H^1$-norm as in the Aubin--Nitsche argument.

Consider the adjoint variational problem: Find $w \in \HozDD$ such that for all $v \in \HozDD$
\beq\label{eq:adjointtheta}
\aT(v,w) = \IPLtD{v}{\thetah}.
\eeq
(I.e., $w$ solves the adjoint problem \cref{eq:adjoint} with right-hand side given by $n\thetah$.) Let $\eh \de u -\uh$ be the finite-element error, put $v = \eh$ in \cref{eq:adjointtheta} and take the complex conjugate\footnote{The reason we take the complex conjugate is that to apply Galerkin orthogonality for $w-\Ph w$, the term $w-\Ph w$ must be the first argument of $\aT$. Alternatively, one could define $\widetilde{\Ph}$ to be the analogue of the elliptic projection but defined in the second argument, show analogues of the error bounds \cref{lem:ellprojerr} and proceed with the proof of this \lcnamecref{lem:ltthetahbound}. However, for simplicity, we instead take the complex conjugate of \cref{eq:adjointtheta}.} to obtain
\beqs
\IPLtD{\thetah}{\eh} = \overline{\aT(\eh,w-\Ph w)} = \aep(w-\Ph w,\eh) - k^2 \IPLtDn{w-\Ph w}{\eh} + ik \NLtGI{w - \Ph w}{\eh}.
\eeqs
By Galerkin orthogonality for $w-\Ph w,$ we have (recalling $\eh = \rho + \thetah$)
\begin{align}
  \IPLtD{\thetah}{\eh} &= \aep(w-\Ph w,\rho) - k^2 \IPLtDn{w-\Ph w}{\eh} + ik \NLtGI{w - \Ph w}{\eh}\nonumber\\
&= \overline{\aT(\rho,w-\Ph w)}  -k^2 \IPLtDn{w-\Ph w}{\thetah} -ik \IPLtGI{w-\Ph w}{\thetah}.\label{eq:doublego}
%&=\aT(\rho,w-\Ph w) -k^2 \IPLtDn{\thetah}{w-\Ph w} -ik \IPLtGI{\thetah}{w-\Ph w}
\end{align}

Therefore as $\eh = \rho + \thetah$ we can rearrange \cref{eq:doublego} and use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to obtain
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}^2 &\leq \Cc\NLiD{n} \NHokD{\rho} \NHokD{w- \Ph w} + k^2 \abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{w- \Ph w}}\nonumber\\
&+ k \abs{\IPLtGI{\thetah}{w-\Ph w}} + \NLtDn{\rho}\NLtDn{\thetah}\label{eq:boundingLtwo}
\end{align}
By combining \cref{lem:bestapprox,lem:ellprojerr}, we can show (as $w$ satisfies an adjoint Helmholtz problem with right-hand side $\thetah$)
\beq\label{eq:wlt}
\NLtD{w - \Ph w} \leq \Cprojfn{0} \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h^2 + \CFEMttilde \CAnk h(hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}
\eeq
and
\beq\label{eq:who}
\NHoD{w - \Ph w} \leq 2\Cprojfn{-1} \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}.
\eeq
We will be able to use \cref{eq:wlt,eq:who} to bound terms involving $w - \Ph w$ in \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}. We first estimate the inner product terms in \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}:
\begin{align}
\abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{w- \Ph w}} &= \abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{\Qhn w - \Ph w}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\Nfn{1-p,h,n}{\Qhn w - \Ph w}\text{ by \cref{lem:intoip}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} \Csumfn{p-1} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}}\NLiD{n}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\sum_{m=0}^{p-1} h^{m}\mleft(\NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn w - w}+ \NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{w - \Ph w}\mright) \text{ by \cref{lem:negdiscsum}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} \Csumfn{p-1}\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}}\NLiD{n} h^{p-1}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\sum_{m=0}^{p-1} \mleft(\CSZfn{p-1-m}\nvar \NLtDn{w - \Ph w} + \Cwfn{p-1-m} \errn{p-1-m} h \NHoDn{w - \Ph w}\mright)\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:wltdprojerr,lem:ellprojerrw}, taking $\wh = \Ph u$ in \cref{lem:ellprojerrw} and \cref{eq:wltdprojerr},}\nonumber\\
&\leq \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} \Csumfn{p-1}\sum_{m=0}^{p-1} \mleft(\CSZfn{p-1-m}\Cprojfn{0} + \Cwfn{p-1-m} \Cprojfn{-1}\mright)                         \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 \nonumber\\
&\quad\quad h^p \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright) \NLtD{\thetah} \text{ by \cref{eq:wlt,eq:who},}\nonumber\\
&=\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}  \Cfourteen \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright) \NLtD{\thetah} \label{eq:innerprod1}.
\end{align}

We now estimate the other inner product term
\begin{align}
\abs{\IPLtGI{\thetah}{w - \Ph w}} &\leq \CMT\CinvVhp\mleft(\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n} k h^{p-\half} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\mright.\nonumber\\
&\mleft.\quad\quad+ \Cboundaryt^{\half} h^{\half} \NHokD{\rho}\mright) h^{-\half}\NLtD{w - \Ph w}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{eq:simple}, \cref{lem:inverseinequality,lem:boundarybound,thm:multiplicativetrace},}
\nonumber\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0}\mleft(\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n} k h^{p} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \Cboundaryt^{\half} h \NHokD{\rho}\mright)\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}\label{eq:innerprod2}
\end{align}
 by \cref{eq:wlt}.

We now insert \cref{eq:wlt,eq:who,eq:innerprod1,eq:innerprod2} into \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}:
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}^2 &\leq \Bigg[\Cc\NLiD{n} \NHokD{\rho} \mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\\
&+k^2\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}  \Cfourteen \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \\
&+k\CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \mleft(\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n} k h^{p} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \Cboundaryt^{\half} h \NHokD{\rho}\mright)\Bigg]\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}\\
&+\NLtDn{\rho}\NLtDn{\thetah}\nonumber\\
%newline
&\leq \Bigg[\mleft(\Cc\mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\NLiD{n} + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \Cboundaryt^{\half} + \Cprojfn{0}\nvar  \mright)\NHokD{\rho} \\
&+\mleft(  \Cfourteen \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0}\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}\mright)k^2h^p\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\Bigg]\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}.\label{eq:nearlythere}
\end{align}
Rearranging \cref{eq:nearlythere} and using \cref{lem:ellprojerr} and the fact that $hk \leq 1$ we have
  \begin{align*}
\NLtD{\thetah}^2&\leq \Bigg[\mleft(\Cc\mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright) + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \Cboundaryt^{\half} + \Cprojfn{0}  \mright)\NHokD{\rho} \nonumber\\
&+\mleft(  \Cfourteen  + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0}\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mright)k^2h^p\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\Bigg]\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}.
\end{align*}
  Using Young's inequality \cref{eq:young} to separate out the $\NLtD{\thetah}$ term on the right-hand side and then moving the resulting $\NLtD{\thetah}^2$ term to the left hand side, followed by \cref{eq:simple}, we obtain
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}&\leq \Bigg[\mleft(\Cc\mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright) + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \Cboundaryt^{\half} + \Cprojfn{0}  \mright)\NHokD{\rho}\nonumber \\
&+\mleft(  \Cfourteen  + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0}\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mright)k^2h^p\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}\Bigg]\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\label{eq:part3penultimate}.
\end{align}
Upon rearranging \cref{eq:part3penultimate} we obtain \cref{eq:ltthetahbound}.

\epf
With all our lemmas proved, we can now prove our main \lcnamecref{thm:fembound}.

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:fembound}]
\label{page:thmfembound}
By \cref{lem:higherbound} (with $m=p-1$) in \cref{eq:ltthetahbound} and using the fact that $\NLiD{n}, \En, \nvar \geq 1$, we have
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}&\leq \mleft(\Cfirst + \Csecond\Chighfn{p-1,2} \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{2-p} \mright)\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NHokD{\rho}\nonumber\\
&+\Csecond  \Chighfn{p-1,1} \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)^{p-1}\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde (hk )^{p+1}+ \CFEMttilde \CAnk h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}\label{eq:doublehkdep}
\end{align}
Choosing $h$ according to \cref{eq:hfemcond}, \cref{eq:doublehkdep} simplifies to
\begin{align*}
\NLtD{\thetah} &\leq \mleft(\Cfirst + \Csecond\Chighfn{p-1,2} \nvar^4\nmin^{1-p} \mright)\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NHokD{\rho} + \half \NLtD{\thetah},
\end{align*}

and therefore it follows that
\beq\label{eq:ltboundwithrho}
\NLtD{\thetah} \leq \nvar^6\nmin^{-(p+1)} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1} \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CLtboundo h + \CLtboundt  \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NHokD{\rho}.
\eeq

It only now remains to bound the $k$-weighted $H^1$ norm of $\thetah.$ By \cref{lem:h1contdisc,lem:higherbound} (with $m=1$) we have
\begin{align}
\SNHoD{\thetah} &\leq \Amin^{\half} \mleft[\Chighfn{1,1} \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)k \NLtD{\thetah}\mright.\nonumber\\
&\mleft.\quad\quad+ \Chighmt \nvar^3\NLiD{n} \NHokD{\rho}\mright],\label{eq:sntheta}
\end{align}

and by combining \cref{eq:sntheta,eq:ltboundwithrho} we obtain (as $hk \leq 1$ and $\nvar,\NLiD{n} \geq 1$)
\begin{align}
\SNHoD{\thetah} &\leq
\mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)\nvar^6\nmin^{-(p+1)} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\mleft(\CHoboundo  +\CHoboundt \CAnk k(hk)^p\mright)\NHokD{\rho}.\label{eq:hoboundwithrho}
\end{align}
Therefore by combining \cref{eq:ltboundwithrho,eq:hoboundwithrho}, using \cref{lem:ellprojerr} with $m=1$ and \cref{lem:scottzhang} to bound $\NHokD{\rho}$, and using the fact that $hk \leq 1,$ we obtain \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound}.

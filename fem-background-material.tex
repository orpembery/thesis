\section{Theory of the Finite-Element Discretisation of the Helmholtz Equation}\label{sec:helmfe}

We now shift our attention to the numerical analysis of the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media; in particular, we  study the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation. We first state the variational formulations of the Helmholtz equation, define the finite element method, and recall results on the approximation properties of finite-element spaces. we then prove our main result, error bounds for the finite-element method for the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation, where the bounds hold for arbitrary (fixed) degree finite elements, and are explicit in $n$ and (in principle) $A$.

a new error bound for the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media.

  \subsection{Variational Formulations for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:varform}
  The finite element method is based on the variational formulation of the Helmholtz equation; for simplicity of exposition, we state the variational formulation of \cref{prob:edp,prob:tedp} in the case $\gD = 0,$ although these can be generalised to the case $\gD \neq 0.$
  
\bprob[Variational formulation of EDP when $\gD = 0$]\label{prob:vedp}
Let $\Dp, A, n,$ and $f$ be as in \cref{prob:edp}. Choose $R>0$ such that $\supp f,$ $\supp(I-A),$ $\supp(1-n) \compcont \BR,$ and define $\DR \de \Dp \cap \BR.$

We say $u \in \HozDDR$ satisfies the \defn{variational formulation of the exterior Dirichlet problem} with $\gD = 0$ if
\beqs
\aE(u,v) = \FE(v)\quad \tfa v \in \HozDDR,
\eeqs
where
\beqs
\aE(w,v) \de \int_{\DR} \mleft(\IPRRd{A \grad w}{\grad v} - k^2 n\minispace w \vbar\mright) - \DPGR{\DtN \trGR w}{\trGR v}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\FE(v) \de \int_{\DR} f\minispace\vbar,
\eeqs
where $\DtN:\HhGR\rightarrow \HmhGR$ is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation $\Lap u + k^2 u = 0$ combined with the Sommerfeld radiation condition in the exterior of $\BR$; and $\DPGR{\cdot}{\cdot}$ is the duality pairing on $\GR.$

\ble[Equivalence of formulations for the EDP]\label{lem:edpform}
\Cref{prob:edp,prob:vedp} are equivalent. If $u \in \HolocDp$ solves \cref{prob:edp} then $u\restrict_{\DR} \in \HozDDR$ and $u\restrict_{\DR}$ solves \cref{prob:vedp}  (for $R$ as in \cref{prob:vedp}). Conversely, if $u \in \HozDDR$ solves \cref{prob:vedp}, then $u$ solves \cref{prob:edp}, if $u$ is extended to $\HolocDp$ by the solution of the exterior Dirichlet problem (in the exterior of $\DR$) for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation with the Sommerfeld radiation condition (with Dirichlet data $\tr u$ on $\partial \BR$).

\subsection{Background Concepts in Finite-Element Theory}\label{sec:fetheory}

We now give a brief summary of elementary concepts in finite-element theory. In the interest of brevity, we focus only on those concepts that we be needed to
prove the new error bound for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation in \cref{sec:fem} below.

Throughout this thesis, we use the terms `mesh` and `triangulation' to refer to a triangulation of simplices in the sense of Ciarlet \cite[(FEM1) p. 61, ($\cT_{h}$5) p. 71]{Ci:91}\optodo{Fix this ref}. Similarly, we use $h$ to denote the mesh size of a mesh\footnote{Frequently in this thesis we will consider families of meshes indexed by their mesh size $h$.}, and we use $\Vhp$ to denote the set of continuous piecewise-polynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh with mesh size $h$.
  %%   triangulation of the domain. (Note that in this thesis we use the words `mesh' and `triangulation' interchangably; strictly speaking, the term `triangulation' only makes sense in 2-d, but we ignore this technicality.

  %%   \bde[Triangulation]
  %%   A triangulation of a polygonal domain $D$ is a finite collection of sets $\Ki \subseteq \Dclos$ such that
  %%   \ben
  %% \item $\interior{\Ki} \cap \interior{\Kj} = \emptyset$ for $ i \neq j,$
  %% \item $\bigcup_i \Ki = \Dclos,$ and

%% \beqs
%% h = \max_{\Ki} \diam{\Ki}.
%% \eeqs
%% \ede

%%     We can now define finite-element spaces associated with a triangulation; we first define the space of polynomials on a set.

%%     \bde[Finite element space of degree $p$]\label{def:fespace}
%%     Given a triangulation $\set{\Ki}$ with mesh size $h$ of a domain $D$, the \defn{(continuous) piecewise-polynomial finite-element space of degree $p$} associated with $\set{\Ki}$ is
%%     \beqs

%%     \eeqs
%%     \ede

Throughout this thesis, we only consider the $h$-finite-element method, i.e., the degree $p$ of the polynomials associated with the space is assumed fixed, and we consider refining $h.$ This is in contrast to the $p$-FEM, where $h$ is fixed and $p$ is increased, and the $hp$-FEM, where both $h$ and $p$ are increased according to some rule. $hp$-FEM methods for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation were analysed by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}; however, their analysis relies on a fully $p$-explicit analysis of the best approximation error of the Helmholtz equation in $hp$-finite-element spaces; such analysis is currently not possible for the heterogeneous problem.

%% The function $\vhptilde$ in \cref{lem:scottzhang} can be constructed using `averaged Taylor polynomials', see, e.g., \cite{ScZh:90},\cite[Section 4.4]{BrSc:08} for details\footnote{Observe that in \cite{BrSc:08}, the authors use different notation to us; they use $m$ to denote the regularity of $v$ and $p$ to denote the integrability of $v,$ i.e., in \cite{BrSc:08}, $v \in \WmpD.$}.
%%     \ere

    With the concept of a finite-element space in place, we can now define the finite-element approximation to the variational problems \cref{prob:vedp,prob:vtedp}.

    \bprob[Finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vtedp}]\label{prob:fevtedp}
    We say that $\uh \in \Vhp$ is the \defn{finite-element approximation of $u$} (the solution to \cref{prob:vtedp}) if
    \beqs
    a(\uh,\vh) = L(\vh) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
    \eeqs
    The finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vedp} is defined analagously.

    \bre[Not considering variational crimes]
    Throughout this thesis we assume that \cref{prob:fevtedp} is a conforming discretisation if \cref{prob:vtedp}, i.e. $\Vhp \subset \HozDDR.$ This inclusion is true if $\DR$ can be triangulated; otherwise, we must modify the definition of \cref{prob:fevtedp} and commit a variational crime by approximating the boundary of $\DR$ by a polygon, or introducing mesh elements with curved boundaries using interpolated boundary conditions or isoparametric finite elements. See, e.g., \cite[Chapter 10]{BrSc:08} for an overview of the additional errors introduced by variational crimes (although not in the context of the Helmholtz equation). In this thesis we  ignore such variational crimes, and the additional errors they induce; such analysis is standard. Therefore for the remainder of this thesis we assume that \cref{lem:scottzhang} holds, even if we have not triangulated the domain $D$ exactly.

%%     \subsection{Error bound for the heterogeneous IIP}\label{sec:errbound}

%%     We now move on to present new work---bounds on the error $\uh-u$ between the finite-element approximation and the true solution of \cref{prob:vtedp}. These bounds, proven here for the Helmholtz equation in \emph{heterogeneous} media are generalisations of results already in the literature that the finite-element error in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms is bounded (as $k\rightarrow \infty$) provided $h \lesssim k^{-(2p+1)/2p}$. These results are crucial for our analysis of the multi-level Monte Carlo method for the Helmholtz equation in \cref{chap:mlmc}.

%% The proof of these results uses a so-called `elliptic projection' technique, introduced by Feng and Wu in \cite{FeWu:09} for Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Helmholtz equation and modified by Du and Wu \cite{DuWu:15}, where the variational formulation of a PDE related to \cref{prob:vtedp} is used as part of the proof. We  only prove results for \cref{prob:fevtedp}, and not for the finite-element approximation of \cref{prob:vedp}, as our proof uses properties of the related PDE and these properties have only been proven with impedance boundary conditions (in the recent preprint \cite{ChNiTo:18}) and not with an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the truncation boundary. However, we imagine the results proven for the related PDE with an impedance boundary condition also hold for an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition, and so we anticipate that the results we prove here also hold for finite-element approximations of \cref{prob:vedp}.\optodo{This paragraph needs rewriting---acknowledge Du \& Wu}

\subsection{Discussion of FEM for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:helmfedisc}

We now discuss three properties of the $h$-FEM for the Helmholtz equation:
\bit
\item The relative error $\displaystyle \frac{\NW{u-\uh}}{\NW{u}}$ is bounded,
\item The error $\NW{u-\uh}$ is bounded in terms of norms of the data $f$ (and $g$ for the IIP), and
  \item The FEM is quasi-optimal, $\displaystyle \NW{u-\uh} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NW{u-\vh}.$
    \eit

    The key question we ask is: What mesh conditions lead to each of the three properties above? (I.e., how must one refine $h$ as $k$ increases in order for the FEM to satisfy each of the three properties above?)

    We will now summarise the state of the literature regarding each of the three properties above. We will:
    \ben
  \item Define each of the three properties formally,
  \item\label{it:sum2} State the sharpest results known in the literature,
  \item\label{it:sum3} Give a complete overview of all results in the literature concerning the three properties,and
    \item\label{it:sum4} Give a detailed discussion of proof techniques for each of the three properties.
      \een

We do \cref{it:sum2,it:sum3} because to our knowledge there is not a complete overview of all of these three properties anywhere in the literature. Moreover, research interest in these three properties has recently increased (e.g., the recent papers \cite{ChNi:18,LiWu:18,ChGaNiTo:18,ChNi:19} are all concerned with one or more of these properties, and have all been completed within the last two years), and so we believe it will be helpful and timely to provide a complete overview of the state of the literature. We do \cref{it:sum4} because collection of the proof techniques used for each of these properties are different to those used for standard finite-element proofs for, e.g., the stationary diffusion equation. Moreover, the different proof techniques are different but related, and we do not know of anywhere in the literature where these techniques are expounded, compared, and constrasted. In view of the resurgence in interest in the properties above, we hope that such a review will be valuable for the research community.

      

\paragraph{Intuition for fixed number of points per wavelength}\optodo{Move this somewhere else} Recall from \cref{sec:numsolve} that if one takes the mesh size in the finite element method $h \sim 1/k$ (for first-order finite elements), then one expects the interpolation (or best approximation) error is bounded uniformly in $k$. More rigorously, as solutions of the Helmholtz equation typically\footnote{If $f$ and $\gD$ are independent of $k$,  combining \cref{thm:edp} and standard elliptic regularity results, e.g., \cite[Theorems 4.16 and 4.18]{Mc:00} gives the fact that $\NHtD{u} \lesssim k$.} have $\NHtD{u} \sim k,$ one can bound the $H^1$-norm of the interpolation error if $h \sim 1/k$ using \cref{lem:scottzhang}.  As explained in \cref{sec:numsolve}, this restriction ensures there are a fixed number of discretisation points per wavelength of the solution, since the wavelength $\lambda = 2\pi/k.$

An alternative motivation for taking $h \sim 1/k$ (for first-order elements) is the Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem\footnote{Proved by Shannon in his seminal paper in information theory \cite[Theorem 1]{Sh:49}.} (see, e.g., \cite[\S 5.21]{BaNaBe:00}) which states that any function $v$ (in 1-d) whose Fourier transform lies inside $[-k,k]$ (for some $k >0$)\footnote{Therefore the highest frequency present in $v$ is $k$.} is completely determined (via its Fourier series) by the point values $v(0)$, $v(\pm \mu),$ $v(\pm2\mu),  \ldots$, for any $\mu < 1/\mleft(2k\mright).$ That is, if we interpolate $v$ at points spaced less than $ \lambda/(4\pi)=1/(2k)$ apart\footnote{Where $\lambda = 2\pi/k$ is the wavelength associated with oscillations of frequency $k$, as above.}, we can reconstruct $v$ from its Fourier transform. Therefore in this case we may reasonably expect that the interpolation of $v$ will also be a good approximation of $v$, as such a spacing of points `captures' all of the oscillations in $v.$

%% The solution of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with constant coefficients is
%% \beq\label{eq:hh-1d}
%% u(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx),
%% \eeq
%% (for some constants $A$ and $B$), and $\lambda = k/2\pi$ as $u$ has Fourier Transform

%% Therefore, if $u$ is sampled at regularly-spaced points that are strictly closer together than $\pi/k = 1/(2\lambda)$, then $u$ can be reconstructed perfectly from these samples.\optodo{Consider writing something about mutliple dimensions} In conclusion, one expects the be able to interpolate the solution of the Helmholtz equation with uniform error in $k$ if $h \sim 1/k.$

%% However, as was stated in \cref{sec:numsolve}, the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation suffers from pollution; and $h \sim 1/k$ is not sufficient to keep the finite-element error bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty.$ Therefore we  now provide an overview of previous work giving mesh conditions under which the finite-element error $\NW{u-\uh}$ is bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty$, as well as mesh conditions under which the finite-element method is quasi-optimal. Concerning errors, it would be more natural to consider the relative error $\NW{u-\uh}/\NW{u};$ and to investigate the conditions on $h$ which enable the relative error to be bounded as $k\rightarrow \infty.$ However, current technology typically only allows us to prove results for the error, not the relative error, and so we investigate the error instead.

%We will now briefly review the literature that seeks to answer the question `What mesh condition will keep the relative error bounded as $k \rightarrow \infty$?'


%% \bde[Bounded finite-element error]
%% Let $(\Th)_{h \in (0,1)}$ be a shape-regular family of triangulations of $\DR$, where we assume $h$ is a function of $k$ (e.g., $h(k) = 1/k$). We say that \defn{the error in the finite-element method is bounded uniformly in $k$} if for all $A,n$ in some class there exists $C(A,n)$ (but independent of $k$ and $h$) such that
%% \beqs
%% \NW{u-\uh} \leq C\mleft(\NLtD{f} + \NLtGD{\gD} + \NLtGI{\gI}\mright).
%% \eeqs
%% \ede



 %% In $d=2$ or $3$ with $D$ a convex polygon or polyhedron,  \cite[Theorem 6.1]{Wu:14} showed that the error (but not the relative error) in both the $H^1$ seminorm and the $L^2$ norm is bounded uniformly in $k$ if $h \lesssim k^{-3/2}$. The proof of \cite[Theorem 6.1]{Wu:14} showed an analagous result for a continuous interior-penalty method, and then took the limit as the penalty parameter tends to 0 to obtain the result for the continuous piecewise-linear finite-element method. In summary, the mesh condition $h \lesssim k^{-3/2}$ seems to be sufficient for the (relative) error to be bounded uniformly in $k.$

\subsubsection{Formal definition of properties of the finite-element method}\label{sec:femprops}

We now formally define the three properties mentioned above. These definitions may seem overly technical, however we believe their technical definition is necessary to capture the, at times, complex behaviour of finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation. After stating the definitions, we give some examples of what they mean for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation. These definitions are based on \cite[Definition 2.3]{DiMoSp:19}.

In the following definitions, we consider the Helmholtz problems \cref{prob:vtedp}, and their discretisations \cref{prob:fevtedp} as parameterised by the wavenumber $k,$ that is, we write $u(k)$ for the solution of \cref{prob:vtedp} with wavenumber $k$, and $\uh(k)$ for its finite-element approximation.

\bde[$\hk{a}{b}$-accurate]\label{def:hkacc}
Given $a,b>0$, we that an $h$-FEM for the Helmholtz equation is \defn{$\hk{a}{b}$-accurate} if, given $0 < \eps < 1,$ and $\kz > 0,$ there exist $\Co(\kz), \Ct(\eps,\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^a \leq \Co
\eeqs
and
\beqs
hk^b \leq \Ct,
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beq\label{eq:hkacc}
\frac{\NW{u(k)-\uh(k)}}{\NW{u(k)}} \leq \eps
\eeq
for all $k \geq \kz.$

If $a=b$ we say the $h$-FEM is $\hka{a}$-accurate.
\ede

\bde[$\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate]\label{def:hkdataacc}
Given $a,b>0$, we that an $h$-FEM for \cref{prob:vtedp} is \defn{$\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate} if, given $0 < \eps < 1,$ and $\kz > 0,$ there exist $\Co(\kz), \Ct(\eps,\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^a \leq \Co
\eeqs
and
\beqs
hk^b \leq \Ct,
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beq\label{eq:hkdataacc}
\frac{\NW{u(k)-\uh(k)}}{\NLtD{f} + \NLtGI{\gI}} \leq \eps
\eeq
for all $k \geq \kz.$

If $a=b$ we say the $h$-FEM is $\hka{a}$-data-accurate.
\ede

Observe that the only difference between the definitions of $\hk{a}{b}$-accurate and $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate is that in \cref{eq:hkacc} the error is measure relative to the solution $u$, whereas in \cref{eq:hkdataacc} the error is measure relative to the `data' $f$ and $\gI$.

\bde[$\hka{a}$-quasi-optimal]\label{def:hkqo}
Given $a > 0,$ we say that an $h$-FEM for the Helmholtz equation is \defn{$\hka{a}$-quasi-optimal} if, given $\kz > 0$, there exist $\Co(\kz), \Cqo(\kz) > 0$ such that if
\beqs
hk^{a} \leq \Co
\eeqs
then the Galerkin solutions $\uh(k)$ satisfy
\beqs
\NW{u(k) - \uh(k)} \leq \Cqo \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NW{u(k) - \vh},
\eeqs
for all $k \geq \kz.$
\ede

\bre[Generalisations of $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accurate]
For distcretisations of other Helmholtz problems (e.g., full-space problems with no truncation boundary $\GI$, or problems truncated with a PML), then the denominator in \cref{eq:hkdataacc} should be adapted appropriately, e.g., the denominator should equation $\NLtD{f}$ for full-space problems and PML problems.\optodo{Truncation of PML?} In our discussion of the literature below (which includes such problems), we will make such an adaption without comment.
\ere

\bre[The above conditions for heterogeneous problems]
Observe that for heterogeneous problems, the constants $\Co, \Ct$, and $\Cqo$ in \cref{def:hkacc,def:hkdataacc,def:hkqo} will all depend on the coefficients $A$ and $n.$ In general, this dependence is unknown. However, in our original work in \cref{sec:fem} below we prove that the $h$-FEM with polynomial degree $p$ is $\hka{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-data-accurate, where the dependence of $\Co$ and $\Ct$ on $n$ (and, in principle, $A$) is completely known.
\ere

To aid understanding of the above definitions, we give the following example.

\bre[Example achieving $\hk{a}{b}$-data-accuracy]
In \cite[Theorem 5.4]{ChGaNiTo:18}, Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise, and Tomezyk prove\footnote{The result proved in \cite[Theorem 5.4]{ChGaNiTo:18} is slightly more complicated than that stated here; the right-hand side of \cref{eq:hkaccceq} should be $\Cth \mleft(hk + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{f}.$ However, an analagous proof to the one presented here in the more complicated case.} that if $k \geq \kz$ and $h^{p+1}k^{p+2} \leq \Co$, then
\beq\label{eq:hkacceg}
\NW{u(k) - \uh(k)} \leq \Cth h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\NLtD{f}
\eeq
for some $\kz, \Co, \Cth > 0.$

For $0 < \eps < 1,$ if we take $\Ct = \eps/\Cth$ then one can see that \cite[Theorem 5.4]{ChGaNiTo:18} shows the $h$-FEM is $\hk{(p+2)/(p+1)}{(2p+1)/(2p)}$-accurate.
\ere

\paragraph{Previous results on the finite-element error} Unless otherwise stated, all of the results we review are for a Helmholtz problem with an impedance (or impedance-like) boundary condition on some part of the domain. Recall such a boundary condition models physically outgoing waves.

Bayliss, Goldstein, and Turkel \cite[\S 3]{BaGoTu:85} performed computations for $d=2$ and first-order finite elements with $D$ a square with Neumann boundary conditions on three sides and an impedance-like boundary condition on the other side. The results of the computations suggested the mesh condition $h \lesssim k^{-3/2}$ is sufficient to bound the relative error in the $L^2$ norm uniformly in $k.$ Ihlenberg and Babuska \cite[Theorem 5, \S 3.4]{IhBa:95} proved that the error in the $H^1$ seminorm for a 1-dimensional problem on an interval is bounded independently of $k$ provided $h^2k^2$ is sufficiently small, and then concluded that the relative error is similarly bounded. However, the proof in \cite{IhBa:95} used the fact that the solution of the Helmholtz equation in 1-d is given by $A \cos(kx) + B \sin(kx)$ (for some constants $A$ and $B$) and so has not been generalised to higher dimensions.

Subsequent work throughout the 19990s and 2000s focused on proving quasi-optimality for the finite-element method, and then concluding bounds on the error; we discuss results on quasi-optimality below. However, recent efforts on proving error bounds have used so-called elliptic projection ideas; these ideas are at the heart of our results in \cref{sec:fem} below, and are discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:prooftechniques} below. To our knowledge, the first use of elliptic projections to prove error estimates for Galerkin approximations was by Wheeler\footnote{Mentioned in \cite{MaNo:03}.} \cite{Wh:73}, who proved bounds on the error for a nonlinear parabolic problem by splitting the error into the error from an elliptic projection and the remaining error between the elliptic projection and the Galerkin approximation.

The idea of using elliptic projections for Helmholtz problems was introduced to prove error bounds for discontinuous Galerkin methods for the TEDP by Feng and Wu \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11}. Wu \cite{Wu:14} then used elliptic projctions to prove that the error in the first-order finite-element method for the IIP is of the order $ h^2k^3$ if $h^2k^3$ is sufficiently small; in \cite{Wu:14} this result was shown for a discontinuous-Galerkin first-order method for the Helmholtz equation, and the results for the standard finite-element method were obtained as a special case. Du and Wu \cite{DuWu:15} extended the results in \cite{Wu:14} to higher-order finite-elements for the IIP, showing that the error is of the order $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}.$ is sufficiently small. Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise \cite{ChNi:18} obtained similar results for first-order finite elements for the TEDP when the scatterer induces corner singularities (and therefore \cite{ChNi:18} includes additional contraints on the mesh arising from the corner singularities that we do not mention here). Wu and Zou \cite[Lemma 3.3]{WuZo:18} obtained the first results for heterogeneous media; they showed the error is bounded if $h^2k^3$ is sufficiently small for first-order finite elements for the IIP. The results in \cite{WuZo:18} were obtained for a special class of heterogeneous media as part of an argument proving similar results for a nonlinear Helmholtz equation. Recently, Li and Wu \cite{LiWu:18} and Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise, and Tomezyk \cite{ChGaNiTo:18} obtained error bounds for a Helmholtz problem truncated with a PML for first-order finite-elements \cite{LiWu:18} and higher order finite-elements \cite{ChGaNiTo:18} under the restrictions $h^2k^3$ sufficiently small and $h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ sufficiently small, respectively.

Observe that the results proved above for higher-order finite elements (the error is bounded if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small) become less stringent as $p$ increases ($h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is bounded if $h \sim k^{-1-1/2p}$). In \cref{sec:fem} we present similar results for general classes of heterogeneous media; that is, we show that the error in the finite-element method is bounded if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small and the underlying PDE is nontrapping.

\paragraph{Previous results on quasi-optimality} As mentioned above, one way to prove error bounds for the Helmholtz equation is to first prove the finite-element method is quasi-optimal, and then conclude that the error is bounded. However, as we  show below, the mesh conditions required for the finite-element method to be quasi-optimal are \emph{more} restrictive than those required for the error to be bounded. Recall that the finite-element method is quasi-optimal if there exists $C>0$, independent of $h$ such that
\beqs
\N{u-\uh} \leq C \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \N{u-\vh};
\eeqs
i.e., up to a constant, $\uh$ is the best approximation to $u$ in the space $\Vhp$ in the norm $\N{\cdot}.$

We first contrast the Helmholtz equation with the stationary diffusion equation \eqref{eq:stdiff}. For the stationary diffusion equation, one immediately obtains quasi-optimality for \emph{any} mesh by C\'ea's Lemma (and one then obtains that the relative error is bounded by \cref{lem:scottzhang}). We emphasise again that this result holds for any mesh, with no restriction on $h.$

However, proving quasi-optimality for the Helmholtz equation is more tricky; C\'ea's Lemma relies on the coercivity of the sesquilinear form, and the sesquilinear forms arising from standard discretisations of the Helmholtz equation are not coercive for large $k$. Therefore, to prove quasi-optimality, one instead uses the Schatz argument, a modification of the Aubin--Nitsche duality argument. The Aubin--Nitsche argument was first introduced by Aubin \cite{Au:67} and Nitsche \cite{Ni:68} for coercive problems, and first adapted for problems satisfying a G\r{a}rding inequality by Schatz \cite{Sc:74}.

The Schatz argument was first used for Helmholtz problems by Melenk in his PhD thesis \cite[Proposition 8.2.7]{Me:95}, he proved that the finite-element method for the Helmholtz equation is quasi-optimal under the very restrictive mesh condition $hk^2$ is sufficiently small\footnote{Observe that for large values of $k,$ the mesh condition $hk^2$ is sufficiently small is prohibitive---it would result in linear systems of size, e.g., $~10^{12}$, for the Helmholtz equation with $k=100$ in 3-D.}. Graham and Sauter \cite[Remark 4.4 b.]{GrSa:18} and Galkowski, Spence, and Wunsch \cite[Theorem 3]{GaSpWu:18} have obtained analogous conditions for first-order finite elements for the IIP \cite{GrSa:18} and the EDP \cite{GaSpWu:18} respectively. A modification of the Aubin--Nitsche argument is used by Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise \cite[Lemmas 1 and 2]{ChNi:19} to obtain quasi-optimality results for higher-order finite elements for general wave propagation problems in heterogeneous and homogeneous media under the mesh condition $h^p k^{p+1}$ is sufficiently small. Chaumont-Frelet, Gallistl, Nicaise, Tomezyk used the Schatz argument for higher-order finite elements for a Helmholtz problem truncated with a PML in \cite{ChGaNiTo:18}, and obtain quasi-optimality if $h^p k^{p+1}$ is sufficiently small.

In conclusion, the error for the finite-element method for Helmholtz problems is bounded if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small, and the finite-element method is quasi-optimal if $hk^2$ is sufficiently small (for first-order finite elements). We  now prove analagous results on the boundedness of the error for heterogeneous Helmholtz problems.\optodo{Check what Theo did, and whether anyone has done qo for higher-order elements.}

\subsection{Extended discussion of proof techniques for finite-element errors for the Helmholtz equation}\label{sec:prooftechniques}
We now discuss in some detail the proof techniques used to show that the finite-element method applied to the Helmholtz equation (i) is quasi-optimal in the weighted $H^1$ norm, or (ii) has bounded error in the weighted $H^1$ norm. We discuss these techniques because they are related, but different, and we hope that discussing the details, and comparing and contrasting these techniques will prove helpful to the research community, and will increase understanding of proofs that are, at times, a little technical. However, we also discuss these results to set the coefficient-explicit bounds in \cref{sec:fem} below in context.

We note that frequently quasi-optimality results are refereed to as \defn{asymptotic} error estimates, and bounded-error results (when they are proved under weaker mesh constraints than asymptotic result) are referred to as \defn{pre-asymptotic} error estimates. This terminology is used because the mesh conditions to ensure quasi-optimality are more restrictive than those for bounded error, and therefore they hold for smaller values of $h.$

For simplicity's sake, our exposition below will assume that we are treating the homogeneous Helmholtz TEDP (i.e., $A=I$ and $n=1$) with $\gI = 0,$ and that the problem is nontrapping\footnote{Recall that we say that the problem is nontrapping if we have a $k$-independent a priori bound.}. Also, we suppress all of the constants involved, instead opting to use $\lesssim$ notation, where $a \lesssim b$ if $a \leq C b,$ with $C$ independent of $k$ and $h$. The new results we present in \cref{sec:fem} below relax all of these assumptions, and the price of being more technical to state.

\subsubsection{Duality arguments}
The first class of arguments we consider are (modified) duality arguments. In these arguments, one uses a G\r{a}rding inequality satisfied by the Helmholtz equation to show that the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm is bounded by the best approximation error, plus error in the $L^2$ norm\footnote{Recall that for the stationary diffusion equation, one can show the finite-element error is bounded by the approximation error simply using coercivity and boundedness of the bilinear form---this is Cea's Lemma.}. One then uses a modification of the standard Aubin--Nitsche duality argument to bound the $L^2$ norm.

To show the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm is bounded by the error in the $L^2$ norm, observe
\begin{align}
\NW{u-\uh}^2 &\leq \Re{a(u-\uh,u-\uh)} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2\nonumber\\
&= \Re{a(u-\uh,u-\vh)} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2\text{ by Galerkin orthogonality}\nonumber\\
&\lesssim \NW{u-\uh}\NW{u-\vh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh}^2,\label{eq:gardingerror}
\end{align}
for any $\vh \in \Vhp.$

The Schatz argument to prove quasi-optimality, outlined below, proceeds to show
\beq\label{eq:schatzbound}
k\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim hk^2 \NW{u-\uh},
\eeq
and combining \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:schatzbound}, one can show quasi-optimality if $hk^2$ is sufficiently small.

In contrast, so-called \defn{elliptic projection} arguments to prove a finite-element error bound, also outlined below, show (in the first-order case)
\beq\label{eq:epbound}
k\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim h^2k^3 \NLtD{f},
\eeq
and then combining \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:epbound} to show the finite-element error is bounded if $h^2k^3$ is sufficiently small---observe this is less restrictive than the requirement $hk^2$ is sufficiently small.
%% \begin{align}
%% \NW{u-\uh}^2 &\lesssim \NW{u-\uh}\NW{u-\vh} + h^2k^3 \NLtD{f}\nonumber\\
%% &\leq \eps \NW{u-\uh}^2 + \frac1\eps \NW{u-\vh}^2 +\mleft(h^2 k^3 \NLtD{f}\mright)^2\label{eq:epboundpart1}
%% \end{align}
%% Taking $\eps$ sufficiently small, and moving the first term in \cref{eq:epboundpart1} to the left-hand side, taking $\vh$ to be the best approximation of $u$ in $\Vhp,$ and using \cref{lem:scottzhang} and the fact that\footnote{For sufficiently smooth $\GD$ and $\GI$---see \cite[Remark 2.14]{GrPeSp:19}} we can show $\NHtD{u} \lesssim k\NLtD{f}$
%% \beqs
%% \NW{u-\uh} \lesssim \mleft(hk + h^2k^3\mright)\NLtD{f}.
%% \eeqs

We will now look over the Schatz argument in more detail. We will see presently that the elliptic projection arguments mentioned above further modify the Schatz argument, and so understanding it to begin with is instructive.

We first establish some notation that will enable us to discuss best approximation errors for solutions of Helmholtz problems. We let $\solfem:\LtD\rightarrow \HoD$ denote the solution operator for \cref{prob:vtedp} with zero impedance boundary condition, and we let $\solfems$ denote the solution operator for the corresponding adjoint problem. That is, for any $\ftilde \in \LtD$ and for all $v \in \HozDD,$
\beqs
a(\solfem(\ftilde),v) = \IPLtD{\ftilde}{v}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
a(v,\solfems(\ftilde)) = \IPLtD{v}{\ftilde}.
\eeqs
There exist obvious generalisations of these operators to the case with non-zero impedance boundary conditions. We next define the approximability constants:
\beqs
\wba \de \sup_{\ftilde \in \LtD}\inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \frac{\NW{\solfem(\ftilde) - \vh}}{\NLtD{\ftilde}}
\eeqs
and
\beqs
\wbaadj \de \sup_{\ftilde \in \LtD}\inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \frac{\NW{\solfems(\ftilde) - \vh}}{\NLtD{\ftilde}}.
\eeqs
We note that we are changing notation slightly from that normally prevelant in the literature; notation for $\wbaadj$ was first introduced by Sauter in \cite[Section 2.2]{Sa:06}, but $\wbaadj$ was instead denoted $\tilde{\eta}$ in \cite{Sa:06}. Later, $\wbaadj$ was denoted $\eta$ in \cite[Equation (4.5)]{MeSa:10}.  When dealing purely with the Schatz argument for quasi-optimality (as in \cite[Section 2.2]{Sa:06}) one only needs consider the approximation of adjoint problems in the duality-argument step, and hence one only needs notation for $\wbaadj$. However, in our exposition of elliptic-projection-based arguments below, we will also need to consider the approximation of non-adjoint\ednote{Both---Is there a word for this? `Standard'?} Helmholtz problems, and hence we adopt the notation above.

\paragraph{The Schatz argument} We now recap the Schatz argument for proving quasi-optimality for an indefinite sesquilinear form. This recapitulation will allow us to see where $\wbaadj$ enters the argument, and will also allow us to compare and contrast this argument with the arguments used to obtain a bounded finite-element error using an elliptic projection.

We let $\xi \in \HozDD$ solve the adjoint Helmholtz problem
\beqs
a(v,\xi) = \IPLtD{v}{u-\uh} \tforall v \in \HozDD.
\eeqs
Then, taking $v = u-\uh,$ we have
\begin{align}
  \NLtD{u-\uh}^2 &= a(u-\uh,\xi)\label{eq:schatz0}\\
  &=a(u-\uh,\xi - \vh) \text{ by Galerkin orthogonality for } u-\uh, \text{ for any } \vh \in \Vhp\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \NW{u-\uh}\NW{\xi-\vh}\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \NW{u-\uh} \wbaadj \NLtD{u-\uh}\nonumber.
\end{align}
Cancelling a factor of $\NLtD{u-\uh},$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:schatz1}
\NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim \wbaadj \NW{u-\uh}.
\eeq
Combining \cref{eq:gardingerror,eq:schatz1}, we have
\beqs
\NW{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \NW{u-\uh}\NW{u-\vh} + \mleft(k\wbaadj\mright)^2 \NW{u-\uh}^2,
\eeqs
and hence by cancelling a factor $\NW{u-\uh}$ and taking the final term on to the left-hand side, we obtain
\beqs
\NW{u-\uh} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NW{u-\vh} \tif k\wbaadj \text{ is sufficiently small}.
\eeqs
All results showing quasi-optimality for the Helmholtz equation (for different finite-element spaces and different domains) can then be seen as simply obtaining estimates on $\eta$ in these different scenarios; this literature is summarised in \cref{tab:qo,tab:moddual,tab:split} below.

\paragraph{Elliptic-projection arguments} We now move on to compare and contrast the Schatz argument given above with so-called elliptic-projection arguments. The main difference in the result of these arguments, compared to the Schatz argument given above, is that elliptic projection arguments only prove a \emph{bound} on the finite-element error, rather than proving quasi-optimality. However, these bounds are obtained under mesh restrictions that are \emph{less restrictive} than those required for quasi-optimality.

The elliptic projection of a function $ w \in \HozDD$ is the finite-element function $\Ph w$ that has the same action as $w$ on the finite-element space $\Vhp$ under some elliptic operator\footnote{The definition of the elliptic projection is dependent on the exact sesquilinear form used in the discretisation of the Helmholtz equation, and on the norm one is using to measure the error. For example, elliptic projection arguments originated in the study of discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Helmholtz equation (in \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11}); therefore the sesquilinear forms associated with the discretisation included penalty terms. These penalty terms were incorporated into the sesquilinear form $\aep$ and the norms used to measure the error also included these penalty terms. In the following exposition, we will work with standard finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation and standard Sobolev norms, and so the elliptic projections we used will be based on this setting.}; i.e., $\Ph w$ is defined by
\beqs
\aep(\vh,\Ph w) = \aep(\vh,w) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
\eeqs
for some sesquilinear form $\aep$, such that $\Ph$ is well-defined. For Helmholtz problems\footnote{Recall we are considering discretisations of \cref{prob:vtedp}, and therefore the sesquilinear form we use is given by \cref{eq:aT}.}, choices for $\aep(\vo,\vt)$ are either
\beqs
\aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt}
\eeqs
or
\beq\label{eq:aepused}
\aep(\vo,\vt) = \IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt} - ik\IPLtGI{\vo}{\vt}.
\eeq
These elliptic projections correspond to finding finite-element approximations of the solution of the PDEs
\begin{align*}
  \Delta w &= F \tin D\\
  w &= 0 \ton \GD\\
  \dn w &= 0 \ton \GI
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  \Delta w &= F \tin D\\
  w &= 0 \ton \GD\\
  \dn w -ikw &= 0 \ton \GI,
\end{align*}
where $F$ is an appropriately chosen function. In the following exposition, we will assume $\aep$ is given by \cref{eq:aepused}.
Since $\Ph$ is a Galerkin projection, one can show that in its energy norm $\Nep{\cdot}$ (equivalent to the $k$-weighted $H^1$ norm $\NW{\cdot}$, with equivalence constants independent of $k$) $\aep$ is coercive and continuous, and hence is quasi-optimal:
\beq\label{eq:epho}
\Nep{w-\Ph w} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \Nep{w-\vh}.
\eeq
Also, by the Aubin--Nitsche duality argument (as $\aep$ is coercive),
\beq\label{eq:eplt}
\NLtD{w-\Ph w} \lesssim h \Nep{w-\Ph w}.
\eeq
\ednote{Euan---you said you wanted to have a discussion about what properties exactly are required for the elliptic projection---hopefully the exposition below is a starting point. I've gone with quasi-optimality for the time being, as it means one can see the analogues with the Schatz argument more clearly. But lets chat about this!}

Combining \cref{eq:epho,eq:eplt} in an elliptic projection arguments is a modification of the Schatz argument above: We start from \cref{eq:schatz0}, but instead of introducing an arbitrary $\vh \in \Vhp$ into the second argument, we instead introduce the elliptic projection $\Ph \xi$ by Galerkin orthogonality for $u-\uh$:
\begin{align}
  \NLtD{u-\uh}^2 &= a(u-\uh,\xi-\Ph\xi)\nonumber\\
  &= \aep(u-\uh,\xi-\Ph\xi) - k^2\IPLtD{u-\uh}{\xi-\Ph\xi}\nonumber\\
  &= \aep(u-\Ih u,\xi-\Ph\xi) - k^2\IPLtD{u-\uh}{\xi-\Ph\xi} \text{ by Galerkin orthogonality for }\xi-\Ph\xi\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \wba \NLtD{f} \wba \NLtD{u-\uh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh} \NLtD{\xi-\Ph\xi}\text{ by \cref{eq:epho}}\nonumber\\
  &\lesssim \wba^2 \NLtD{f}\NLtD{u-\uh} + k^2 \NLtD{u-\uh} h\wba \NLtD{u-\uh}\text{ by \cref{eq:epho,eq:eplt}.}\label{eq:schatz2}
\end{align}
Therefore if $hk^2\wba$ is sufficiently small, the second term in \cref{eq:schatz2} can be absorbed into the left-hand side, and cancelling a factor of $\NLtD{u-\uh},$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:ep1}
k \NLtD{u-\uh} \lesssim k \wba^2 \NLtD{f} \tif hk^2\wba \text{ is sufficiently small}
\eeq
(we consider $k\NLtD{u-\uh}$ so as to compare with the quasi-optimality results above, as the $L^2$ term in $\NW{\cdot}$ is also multiplied by a factor $k$).

To obtain a bound on the error in the weighted $H^1$ norm, we take $\vh = \Ih u$ in \cref{eq:gardingerror}, where $\Ih$ denotes the interpolant if the interpolant is well-defined, or the Scott--Zhang quasi-interpolant \cite{ScZh:90}, so that
\beq\label{eq:interpqo}
\NW{u - \Ih u} \lesssim \inf_{\vh \in \Vhp} \NW{u - \vh}.
\eeq
We then obtain for any $\eps > 0$ by Cauchy's inequality
\beq\label{eq:ep2}
\NW{u-\uh}^2 \lesssim \eps \NW{u-\uh}^2 + \frac1\eps\NW{u-\Ih u}^2 + \mleft(k\wba^2\mright)^2 \NLtD{f}^2.
\eeq
Taking $\eps$ sufficiently small, moving the first term on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:ep2} to the left-hand side, and taking a square root, we obtain
\beqs
\NW{u-\uh} \lesssim \NW{u-\Ih u} + k\wba^2 \NLtD{f},
\eeqs
and thus by \cref{eq:interpqo} and the definition of $wba$
\beq\label{eq:ep3}
\NW{u-\uh} \lesssim \mleft(\wba + k\wba^2\mright) \NLtD{f} \tif hk^2\wba\text{ is sufficiently small}.
\eeq

The term $\wba$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:ep3} is the best-approximation error (see \cref{sec:helmfedisc,lem:scottzhang} above), and the term $k\wba^2$ is the \defn{pollution} term arising from the numerical method. As for the quasi-optimality results above, we remark that different bounds on the finite-element error (for different finite-element space $\Vhp$ and different domains) can be thought of as proving bounds on $\eta$ in these different situations.
\optodo{Put somewhere the stuff they write about dispersion error.}
\ednote{Both---I don't yet have a clear explanation of \emph{why} this works. Currently, it seems just like a trick to me.}
\subsubsection{Error-splitting arguments}\label{sec:errorsplit}
The second class of arguments used in the literature are error-splitting arguments, used to prove a bound on the finite-element error. In these arguments the finite-element error is split using the elliptic projection of the solution $u$. To begin, we make the trivial observation that
\beqs\label{eq:split1}
u-\uh = \mleft(u-\Ph u\mright) + \mleft(\Ph u - \uh\mright).
\eeqs
Proving an error bound for $u-\uh$ therefore reduces to proving an error bound for the elliptic projection error $u- \Ph u$ and proving a bound on the difference $\Ph u - \uh.$ The former can either be accomplished by showing quasi-optimality of the elliptic projection (as above) or by proving such an error bound directly. The former approach is taken in \cite{DuWu:15,LiWu:18,ChGaNiTo:18}, and The latter approach is taken in \cite[Lemma 5.2]{FeWu:09} (althought the proof is only contained in \cite[Lemma 5.2]{FeWu:08}), \cite[Lemma 4.3]{FeWu:11}, and \cite[Lemma 4.2]{Wu:14}. In \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11,Wu:14} the bound on the elliptic projection error is proved by observing that the sesquilinear form $\IPLtD{\grad \vo}{\grad \vt}$ is coercive on $\HozDD$, and then also controlling the additional term arising from the impedance boundary condition.

To bound the difference $\Ph u - \uh,$ one first shows that it solves a deterministic Helmholtz problem:
For $u-\uh,$ for any $\vh \in \Vhp$ we have $a(u-\uh,\vh) = 0$ and $\aep(u-\Ph u,\vh) = 0$ by Galerkin orthogonality for $u-\uh$ and $u-\Ph u$ respectively\footnote{For the arguments in this \namecref{sec:errorsplit}, we define the elliptic projection in the first argument, see \cref{eq:ellprojfirst} below.}. Therefore
\begin{align*}
  a(\Ph u - \uh,\vh) &= a(\Ph u - u,\vh) + a(u-\uh,\vh)\\
  &= a(\Ph u - u,\vh)\\
  &= \aep(\Ph u - u,\vh) - k^2\IPLtD{\Ph u - u}{\vh}\\
  &= - k^2\IPLtD{\Ph u - u}{\vh},
\end{align*}
that is, $\Ph u - \uh$ solves the \emph{discrete} Helmholtz problem
\beqs
a(\Ph u - \uh,\vh) = \IPLtD{\ftilde}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp,
\eeqs
where $\ftilde = k^2\mleft(u-\Ph u\mright).$ One then uses the fact that $\Ph u - \uh$ satisfies a discrete Helmholtz problem to prove a bound on the difference directly.

In \cite{FeWu:09,FeWu:11,Wu:14} a discrete multiplier argument is used to prove a bound on $\Ph u - \uh$, reminiscent of the multiplier arguments used to prove a priori bounds on Helmholtz problems in \cref{sec:pdetheory}. In \cite{DuWu:15} an argument using higher-order (discrete) norms is used in an argument conceptually similar to the modified duality arguments above; this argument is the heart of the proof in \cref{sec:fem} below. In essence the argument in \cite{DuWu:15} reduces to showing the bounds
\beq\label{eq:duwu1}
\NLtD{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim \mleft(h + \mleft(hk\mright)^p\mright)\NW{u-\Ph u} + \mleft(h^{p+1}k^2 + h^{2p}k^{p+2}\mright)\Nfn{p-1,h}{\Ph u - \uh}
\eeq
and
\beq\label{eq:duwu2}
\Nfn{p-1,h}{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim h^{2-p} \NW{u- \Ph u} + k^{p-1} \NLtD{\Ph u - \uh},
\eeq
where $\Nfn{p-1,h}{\cdot}$ is a discrete norm analagous to the Sobolev norm of order $p-1$. \Cref{eq:duwu1,eq:duwu2} are then combined to show
\beqs
\NLtD{\Ph u - \uh} \lesssim \mleft(h + \mleft(hk\mright)^p\mright)\NW{u-\Ph u} + \mleft(\mleft(hk\mright)^{p+1} + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{\Ph u -\uh},
\eeqs
and the final term can be absorbed into the left-hand side if $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small.

%\optodo{For this section; for the first set you only need a bound on the elliptic projection error (with the right powers of $h$ and $k$). For the second one, We use quasi-optimality in $H^1$, the lower-order bounds in terms of the higher-order one, and a bound on the best approximation error. Maybe you could combine the first and third and get away with a bound on the elliptic projection error with the correct powers?}

Observe that when using the elliptic projection in such a splitting argument, there are two differences compared to the use of an elliptic projection in modified duality arguments:
\ben
\item One does not need the elliptic projection to be quasi-optimal \cref{eq:epho}, rather, one only need to bound the error $\NW{u-\Ph u}$, where $u$ solves a Helmholtz problem, in terms of $\NLtD{f}$.
\item The elliptic projection should be defined in the first argument, not the second, i.e.
  \beq\label{eq:ellprojfirst}
a(\Ph u,\vh) = a(u,\vh) \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
  \eeq
\een

\subsubsection{Merits and drawbacks of each argument}
We now briefly discuss the positive and negative points for each of the two classes of argument we have outlined above; duality arguments and splitting arguments.

The merits of duality arguments are their simplicity---we have stated the arguments almost in their entirety above (the only part left unstated is how to bound $\wba$ and $\wbaadj$), and they are closely related with familiar duality arguments used in finite-element-error analysis for more familiar problems, such as the stationary diffusion equation. In addition, it is straightforward to see that for higher-order finite elements (or $hp$-finite-elements) if one knows the dependence of $\wba$ and $\wbaadj$ on $h$, $p$, and $k$, then one can easily conclude error bounds under certain mesh conditions, where both the bounds and the conditions are completely $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-explicit. Such an analysis was performed for quasi-optimality of $hp$-finite-element methods for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media by Melenk and Sauter \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}, where $\wbaadj$ was bounded using a profound splitting of the solution of the Helmholtz equation.

However, the main drawback of duality arguments is their lack of sharpness in the conditions imposed on $h$. For example, if we assume $p$ is fixed and $\wba \lesssim h + \mleft(hk\mright)^p$ (as is shown, for example, by Chaumont-Frelet and Nicaise in \cite[Lemma 1]{ChNi:19}), then the condition `$hk^2\eta$ is sufficiently small' in \cref{eq:ep3} translates to requiring `$h^2k^2 + h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ is sufficiently small'; this final condition is ensured if $h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ is sufficiently small. However, the pollution term in \cref{eq:ep3} is of the form\footnote{If $hk \lesssim 1$.} $k\wba^2 \lesssim h^2k + h^{2p}k^{2p+1} \lesssim h + h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$; that is, the mesh restriction under which we can prove a finite-element error bound (`$h^{p+1}k^{p+2}$ is sufficiently small') is \emph{more restrictive} than the mesh restriction needed to bound the pollution error uniformly in $k$ (`$h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small').

In contrast, the merit of splitting arguments is that they can give mesh conditions that are sharp in their $p$-dependence; in \cite{DuWu:15}, Du and Wu proved that the pollution term in the finite-element error is of the order $h^{2p}k^{2p+1},$ and they do so under the restriction that $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small, i.e., the mesh restriction under which they prove a finite-element error bound is of the same order as the mesh restriction needed to bound the pollution error uniformly in $k.$

However, the drawback of splitting arguments is their complexity. As stated above, obtaining a priori bounds on the difference $\Ph u - \uh$ involves proving bounds on the solution of discrete Helmholtz problems; such bounds are complicated to prove, especially in the higher-order cases (as in \cite{DuWu:15} and in \cref{sec:fem} below), and the constants involved depend on the polynomial degree $p$ in highly complicated ways. These drawbacks limit the likelihood that such bounds can be used for $hp$-finite-element methods, where the dependence on the polynomial degree must be known explicitly.

\subsubsection{Complete technical overview of the literature}\label{sec:litsum}
We now give a brief overview of the literature on rigorous quasi-optimality/error bounds for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation, where the proofs use one of the techniques outlined above. We record this information tersely, having given more insight into the various techniques above. In the columns marked `mesh condition' the quantities listed must be sufficiently small, e.g., if `mesh condition' reads `$hk^2$' then the condition is `$hk^2$ sufficiently small'. If a quantity depends on $p$, but `$p$ fixed' is not specified, then the result holds for varying $p,$ i.e., for $hp$-finite-element methods. IF $p$ does not appear, then the results are for first-order finite-element methods only.

%%5 Can put the below somewhere %%

%% To keep the finite-element error bounded when solving \eqref{eq:introdet}, one must over-refine the numerical grid. That is, rather than using a fixed number of points per wavelength, one must increase the number of points per wavelength as $k$ increases. To achieve bounded finite-element error, one must refine the finite-element mesh size $h$ like $k^{-3/2}$. Whilst this result has been known numerically for some time, it was proven for \eqref{eq:introdet} only with constant coefficients (on various domains and for various finite-element spaces) in \cite{IhBa:95a,Wu:14,DuWu:15,ChNi:18}, and the first proof (to our knowledge) for \eqref{eq:introdet} with heterogeneous coefficients  is contained in \cref{chap:background}. Choosing $h \sim k^{-3/2}$ means \eqref{eq:intromat} is a linear system of size $k^{3d/2}$, larger than if one merely wants the interpolation error to be bounded. Hence, requiring a bounded finite-element error gives rise to very large linear systems.

%% More briefly, if one wants the finite-element solution to be quasi-optimal (that is, up to a constant, the finite-element solution is the best approximation in the finite-element space), then one must over-refine even more, and take $h \sim k^{-2}$. This mesh condition will give rise to linear systems with $k^{2d}$ degres of freedom. See \cref{chap:background} for further details on the necessity of this mesh condition, and further discussion of all the mesh conditions discussed above.\optodo{EDIT THE ABOVE TO REMOVE `OVER-REFINE'}


%% \subsection{New error bounds for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media}\label{sec:heterr}
%% In this section, we prove that the finite-element approximation of the solution to the Helmholtz TEDP exists if $ h \lesssim k^{-3/2}.$ Moreover, we give an expression for the hidden constant that is completely explicit in $A$ and $n$, and we also prove a bound on the finite-element error, again completely explicit in $A$ and $n$. The argument in this section closely follows those in \cite{FeWu:11,ChNi:18} in its use of an elliptic projection argument to prove the required finite-element existence result and error bound. The paper \cite{FeWu:11} proved a similar result for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media, and \cite{ChNi:18} does so for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation with corner singularities.

%% Whilst we prove the results in this section for the TEDP, we expect that they can be extended to the Helmholtz Exterior Dirichlet Problem (EDP) where the infinite domain is truncated, and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is realised exactly on the truncated boundary. However, our proof below uses recently-proved bounds on the solution of a related problem to the TEDP from \cite{ChNiTo:18}; in order to extend our results to the EDP we would need analogues to the results in \cite{ChNiTo:18} for the EDP.

Our proofs below will use results from \cite{ChNiTo:18}, which are stated for the TEDP with zero Dirichlet boundary condition and $L^2$ right-hand side. To avoid the complications stated above, and to allow us to use the results in \cite{ChNiTo:18}, we therefore impose the additional smoothness on $\gD.$ Also, in the case with $F$ only in $\HozDDprime$, proving a priori bounds on the solution of the TEDP is more complicated (c.f., e.g., \cite[Theorem 2.5]{GrPeSp:19} and \cite[Corollary 2.16]{GrPeSp:19} which consider the analogous EDP). For the same reason, we assume $A \in \WoiDRRdtd;$ if we only had $A \in \LiDRRdtd,$ we could reformulate $F$ as outlined above, but we would have the same complications as just described.

\section{New Finite-Element-Error bounds for the Heterogeneous Helmholtz Equation}\label{sec:fem}

We now prove our new error bounds for the higher-order finite-element approximation of the solution of the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media. Our results are a generalisation of results proved by Du and Wu \cite{DuWu:15} for higher-order finite-element approximations of the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media; our results and proofs broadly follow those in \cite{DuWu:15}, with the differences that: (i) we modify the proofs to cater for the heterogeneity of the coefficients, and (ii) the dependence of our results on all of the constants involved is explicit. In particular our results are (in principle) explicit in $A$  and $p$ and are explicit in $n$ and $k$.

The proofs of our results have many parts, and appear technical, largely due to the burden of explicitly keeping track of all of the constants involved. However, in essence, the proof consists of two ideas:
\ben
\item Decompose the error $u-\uh = (u - \Ph u) + (\Ph u - \uh)$, where $\Ph u$ is an `elliptic projection' of $u$, and
\item Bound the error $u - \Ph u$ using the fact that $\Ph u$ is a Galerkin projection.
\item Bound the error $\Ph u - \uh$ in higher-order `discrete' norms.
\een

In order to use this notion of discrete norms, we develop a notion of discrete derivatives. Also, a number of different Galerkin projections (including the `elliptic projection' mentioned above) play a key role in the proofs, and so we prove error bounds for these projections. Our results also use best approximation results for the Helmholtz equation, and we prove these, following the techniques in \cite{ChNi:19}, but ensuring that these results are explicit in all of the constants involved.
\optodo{Put in structure summary once it's settled down.}
As we are using higher-order finite elements (which we assume are of degree $p$), we will require extra smoothness assumptions on $A$, $n,$ and the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$. We also make simple assumptions on $k,$ $\nmin$, and $\NLiD{n}$ in order to simplify our calculations.

Also, throughout this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} we assume we are working with the finite-element space defined in \cref{def:fespace}, and that consequently \cref{lem:scottzhang} holds.

\bas\label{ass:htwo}
\Cref{prob:vtedp} (and its adjoint) has a unique solution $u$ in $\HtD$, and there exists $\CAnk>0$ (possibly dependent on $A$, $n,$ and $k$) such that
\beq\label{eq:generalhtwo}
k \NLtD{u} + \SNHoD{u} + \frac1k \SNHtD{u} \leq \CAnk \Cfg,
\eeq
where $\Cfg \de \NLtD{f} + \NLtGI{\gI}$.

Finally, we make the following \lcnamecref{ass:convenient} to simplify the proofs in this section. \Cref{ass:convenient} is by no means necessary, but greatly simplifies the proofs.

\bas[Assumptions for convenience of proofs]\label{ass:convenient}
Assume: $k \geq 1$, $\NLiD{n} \geq 1,$ $\nmin \leq 1$, $hk \leq 1$, and there exists $\Ctildemin > 0$ independent of $k$ such that $\CAnk k \geq \Ctildemin.$
\eas
%Note that one could require $\NHhGI{\gI}$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:generalhtwo} (as $\gI \in \HhGI$); however, since the bound in \cref{thm:tedp} only has $\NLtGI{\gI}$, we use the form \cref{eq:generalhtwo} to include \cref{thm:tedp}.

Throughout this \lcnamecref{sec:fem}, we adopt the following piece of notation.
\beqs

%The quantity $\En$ arises from bounds on the `elliptic projection' mentioned above in weighted norms, see \cref{lem:ellprojerrw} below.

Whilst the calculations in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} are explicit in all the constants involved, these dependencies are complex and, to a large extent, unnecessary to understand the arguments. Therefore, for ease of reference, the definition of all the constants (which are many-layered and interdependent) are given in \cref{app:constants}; i.e., any constant introduced or defined in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} will be listed in \cref{app:constants}.

\subsubsection{Discussion of new finite-element-error bounds}

\bre[Relationship of new bounds to the work of Du and Wu]
In \cite{DuWu:15} Du and Wu proved that the error for high-order finite-element methods for the \emph{homogeneous} Helmholtz interior impedance problem is bounded provided $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ is sufficiently small. Our proof follows theirs, and achieves analagous results---observe that the condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} requires $h^{2p}k^{2p+1}$ to be sufficiently small, where the `sufficient smallness' condition depends on $A$ and $n$. We note that our results and proof have the following modifications to those of Du and Wu (the modifications listed in order of their impact upon the proof).
\ben
\item We prove bounds for \emph{heterogeneous} $A$ and $n$; in particular, in several places in the proof we must work with $n$-weighted inner products and norms; see \cref{rem:why} for more details on why $n$-weighted inner products and norms are required.
\item We explicitly track all of the constants involved in the proof---out results are completely explicit in $n$, and are, in theory, explicit in $A$ (see \cref{rem:explicita} below for information on the explicitness in $A$.
\item We allow the possibility that the Helmholtz problem is trapping---the constant $\CAnk$ appearing in \cref{eq:hfemcond} may depend on $k$ (as well as $A$ and $n$). If the Helmholtz problem was nontrapping, $\CAnk$ would be independent of $k$.
  \item We assume the existence of a Dirichlet scatterer $\Dm,$ as opposed to only considering the interior impedance problem, where $\Dm=\emptyset.$
\een
\ere

\bre[Why are the results not fully explicit in $A$?]\label{rem:explicita}
The condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} and the bounds \cref{eq:femlt,femho} are not fully explicit in $A$, i.e. the constants $\Ccond, \CcorLt,$ and $\CcorHo$ may depend on $A$. This dependence is because the constants in the shift theorem for the stationary diffusion equation (\cref{thm:shift}) below are not explicit in their $A$-dependence.\optodo{Check there's no other places this comes up.} In principle one can determine this dependence (it is determined for a right-hand side in $\LtD$ and a solution in $\HtD$ in \cite[Appendix A]{ChScTe:13}).
\ere

\bre[Why the appearance of $\nvar$?]\label{rem:nvar}
The quantity $\nvar = \NLiD{n}/\nmin$ appears in multiple places in the definition of the $n$-dependent constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n).$ This appearance is mainly due to the fact that in multiple places in the proof of \cref{thm:fembound}, we must convert from working in an $n$-weighted norm to a standard norm, and then later convert back to an $n$-weighted norm again. The necessity for this conversion is frequently because certain results (such as \cref{thm:shift,lem:poincare,thm:trace,thm:multiplicativetrace}) are only available in the literature in standard (non-$n$-weighted) norms, and so to apply these results we must first transfer to non-$n$-weighted norms, apply the results, and then tranfer back. If one could prove these results for $n$-weighted norms (under sufficient smoothness conditions on $n$) with constants that were completely explicit in $n$, then many of the instances of $\nvar$ could be removed.

\bre[Bounds not sharp in $n$]\label{rem:nsharp}
The $n$-dependence of the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ is almost certainly not sharp, because
\ben
\item The proof of \cref{thm:fembound} is complex, and involves recursively applying bounds on finite-element functions (as in, e.g., the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}, see \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum,eq:oddrecursive}). These arguments may well result in non-sharp $n$-dependence.
  \item As described in \cref{rem:nvar} above, many of the appearances of $\nvar$ in the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ is purely due to changing norms, then changing back, and so it is possible that the dependence of these constants on $\nvar$ (and therefore $n$) is not sharp.
\een
\ere

\bre[$p$-dependence]
if one wants to prove error bounds for $hp$-finite-element methods, then one must know explicitly how the error bounds \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound} depend on $p$ as well as $h$ and $k$; such an analysis was carried out for the Helmholtz equation in homogeneous media by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11} and for the related time-harmonic Maxwell's equation in homogeneous media in \cite{MeSa:18}. In principle (as our results are explicit in all of the constants involved) one could calculate the $p$-dependence, however, such dependence is likely to be highly complicated, and may very well not be sharp, for similar reasons that the $n$-dependence of our results may not be sharp, as outlined in \cref{rem:nsharp} above.
\ere

\bre[Special cases of $n$]
In order to understand the constants $\Condn(n), \CLtn(n),$ and $\CHon(n)$ it may be instructive to note their behaviour in the following three cases:
\bit
\item If $n=1,$ then $\Condn(n)=1, \CLtn(n)=1,$ and $\CHon(n)=2$.
\item If $\nmin$ is fixed, and $\NLiD{n} \rightarrow \infty,$ then $\Condn(n)\rightarrow 0,$ (i.e., the condition \cref{eq:hfemcond} becomes more restrictive), $\CLtn(n)\rightarrow \infty,$ and $\CHon(n)\rightarrow \infty$.
\item If $\NLiD{n}$ is fixed, and $\nmin \rightarrow 0,$ then $\Condn(n)\rightarrow 0,$ $\CLtn(n)\rightarrow \infty,$ and $\CHon(n)\rightarrow \infty$.
  \eit
  One can easily check each of these behaviours using the definition of $\nvar$, the definition of the constants $\Condn(n),$ $\CLtn(n)$, and $\CHon(n)$, and the definition of the polynomial $\Pfn(x)$ in \cref{eq:p} below, and the defintion of $\En$ in \cref{eq:en} below.
  \ere

  \bre[Extension to different boundary conditions on $\GI$]
  As in \cite[Remark 5.4(e)]{DuWu:15}, we remark that it is not obvious how to extend the proof of \cref{thm:fembound} to a Helmholtz problem with an exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition on $\GI.$ In \cref{lem:higherbound,lem:thetahbound} one must bound terms involving $\thetah$ on the truncation boundary $\GI$; these bounds are achieved using \cref{lem:boundarybound}, which bounds $\NLtGI{\thetah}$ by higher-order discrete norms of $\thetah$ and the weighted $H^1$-norm of $\rho.$ However, a crucial part of the proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound} is the fact that one has the bound $k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \lesssim \IPLtGI{\DtNapprox \thetah}{\thetah}$, where $\DtNapprox$ is the impedance approximation to the DtN map $\DtN,$ i.e. $\DtNapprox = ik.$

  To replicate the proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound} for an exact DtN boundary condition, one would need to show that $k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \lesssim \IPLtGI{\DtN \thetah}{\theta}$ for the \emph{exact} DtN map $\DtN.$ As mentioned in \cite[Remark 5.4(e)]{DuWu:15}, whether such a bound holds in general is an open question.\optodo{Melenk and Sauter '10 equation 3.4b, unlikely, but not that interesting numerically.}

\subsection{Decomposition of solution and best approximation bound}

For the first part of the proof of \cref{thm:fembound}, we prove a best approximation bound in $\Vhp$ for the solution of the Helmholtz equation; following the presentation in \cite{ChNi:19} (although we explicitly keep track of the constants involved at each point). In order to obtain bounds for high $p$, we require the following shift \lcnamecref{thm:shift}:

\bth[Shift theorem]\label{thm:shift}
Under \cref{ass:highp}, for all integers $l \in \mleft[0,p-1\mright]$ there exists a constant $\CAl>0$ (depending on $A$) such that if $\ftilde \in \HlD$ and $\gItilde \in \HlphGI$, then there exists a unique $\utilde \in \HlptD$ such that $\utilde$ solves
\beq\label{eq:shifteq}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A \grad \utilde\mright) = -\ftilde,
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:shiftdbc}
\dn \utilde = \gItilde, \tand
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:shiftnbc}
\trD \utilde = 0
\eeq
and $\utilde$ satisfies the bound
\beq\label{eq:shift}
\NHlptD{\utilde} \leq \CAl \mleft(\NHlD{\ftilde} + \NHlphGI{\gItilde}\mright).
\eeq
\enth

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:shift}]
The uniqueness and existence of $\utilde$ (in $\HozDD$) follows from the Lax--Milgram theorem, as the variational formulation of \cref{eq:shifteq,eq:shiftdbc,eq:shiftnbc} is bounded and coercive. The proof for the higher regularity bounds uses standard elliptic regularity estimates in the interior and near the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$, and the work of the proof is combining these estimates. As a reference for these estimates we use \cite[pp. 137-138]{Mc:00}; \cref{ass:highp} means we can apply these results, as we have higher regularity of the boundaries $\GD$ and $\GI$ and the coefficient $A$.

To deal with the interior regularity and regularity near the boundary separately, we define the following subsets of $D$: $\Dint,\Dinttilde,\Dscat,$ and $\Dtrunc$\optodo{Put this in a picture - sketch is in Research 17, notes for 17th May} with the following properties:
\bit
\item $\Dint \compcont \Dinttilde \compcont D$,
\item $\GD \subset \Dscatclos$
\item $\dist(\Dscat,\GI) > 0 $
  \item $\GI \subset \Dtruncclos$
\item $\dist(\Dtrunc,\GD) > 0 $
    \eit
    First applying interior regularity \cite[Theorem 4.16]{Mc:00} in $\Dinttilde,$ we obtain the bound
    \beq\label{eq:shiftint}
\NHlptDint{\utilde} \leq \CintAl \mleft(\NHoDinttilde{\utilde} + \NHlDinttilde{\ftilde}\mright).
\eeq
Applying regularity up to the boundary for Dirichlet data \cite[Theorem 4.18 (i)]{Mc:00} in $\Dscat,$ we obtain (as $\trD \utilde = 0$)
\beq\label{eq:shiftscat}
\NHlptDscat{\utilde} \leq \CscatAl \mleft(\NHoD{\utilde} + \NHlD{\ftilde}\mright)
\eeq
and similarly\optodo{Spell checker} for Neumann data \cite[Theorem 4.18 (ii)]{Mc:00} in $\Dtrunc,$ we obtain
\beq\label{eq:shifttrunc}
\NHlptDtrunc{\utilde} \leq \CtruncAl \mleft(\NHoD{\utilde} + \NHlphGI{\dn \utilde} + \NHlD{\ftilde}\mright).
\eeq
Combining \cref{eq:shiftint,eq:shiftscat,eq:shifttrunc}, we obtain \cref{eq:shift}.
\epf




%% The following trace theorem is standard, see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 3.37]{Mc:00}.


The following \lcnamecref{lem:domainshift} follows from \cref{thm:shift}.

\bco\label{lem:domainshift}

The proof of \cref{lem:domainshift} requires the Trace theorem.

\bth[Trace Theorem]\label{thm:trace}
If $v \in \HmD,$ for $1/2 < m \leq p+1$, then there exists $\CTrm > 0$ independent of $v$ such that
\beqs

and the result follows.

\bre[How oscillatory are the functions in \cref{thm:expansion}?]
Recall that a higher power of $k$ appearing in an a priori bound indicates that a function is more oscillatory. In \cref{eq:expansionuj} below, the $(j+2)$th-order norm of $\usj$ is of order $k^j$ (i.e., the power of $k$ is two orders of magnitude less than the order of the norm) whereas in \cref{eq:expansionuosc} the $(p+1)$st-order norm of $\uosc$ is of order $k^p$ (the power of $k$ is one order of mangitude less that the order of the norm). Therefore, in this sense, $\uosc$ is `more oscillatory' than $\usj.$

\Cref{thm:expansion} is essentially just \cite[Theorem 1]{ChNi:19} in the particular case of a Helmholtz problem, but with the dependence on all the constants kept track of. The results in \cite{ChNi:19} are stated for a much wider class of problems, but the dependence on all of the constants is not made explicit.

We also point out that \cref{thm:expansion} is reminiscent of results by Melenk and Sauter in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11}who show, for the homogeneous Helmholtz equation that the solution $u$ can be decomposed as $u = \uHt + \uA,$ where $\uHt \in \HtD$ but is not oscillatory ($\NHtD{\uHt} \lesssim 1$), and $\uA \in C^\infty(D),$ but $\uA$ is oscillatory ($\NHmD{\uA} \lesssim k^{s-2}$ for all $s$)\footnote{These results are proved with no obstacle and $f$ given by a Dirac delta function in \cite[Lemma 3.5]{MeSa:10} and for: (i) the IIP with a bounded Lipschitz boundary that is either a 2-D polygon or analytic, or (ii) the EDP with an analytic scatterer, in \cite[Theorems 4.10, 4.20]{MeSa:11} respectively, under an assumption of a polynomial growth of the a priori bound---i.e., $\CAnk$ is a polynomial in $k$.}. This decomposition is used in \cite{MeSa:10,MeSa:11} to prove convergence results for $hp$-finite element methods for the Helmholtz equation. %We note that the results in this \lcnamecref{sec:fem} could, in principle, be used in the analysis of $hp$-methods, as it is, in principle, possible to track the dependence of the constants on the polynomial degree $p.$
\ere

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:expansion}]
The idea of the proof is as follows. We write $u$ as a formal series expansion
\beq\label{eq:formalseries}
u = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \usj,
\eeq
and then substitute this series into the PDE \cref{eq:tedp} and the boundary condition \eqref{eq:ibc}. Equating powers of $k$, we derive a recursive sequence of stationary diffusion equations for the functions $\usj,$ with right-hand sides dependent on $\ujmo$ and $\ujmt$. We use this recursive sequence and \cref{lem:domainshift} to prove the a priori bounds \cref{eq:expansionuj}. We then define the $l$th remainder $\rl = u - \sum_{j=0}^{l-1} \usj,$ and by applying the operator $\grad\cdot\mleft(A\grad \cdot\mright)$ with Neumann boundary conditions to $\rl$, we obtain a recursive sequence for the remainders $\rl,$ and can similarly prove a priori bounds for the $\rl$s. The oscillatory function $\uosc$ is then just $\rpmo.$ The format of this proof is identical to that in \cite[Theorem 1]{ChNi:19}, except we keep track of all of the constants involved.

For the purposes of the proof, it is more convenient to define $\vj = \usj/k^j,$ so that the series expansion \cref{eq:formalseries} becomes
\beq\label{eq:formalseriesv}
u = \sum_{j=0}^\infty k^j\vj
\eeq
as in \cite{ChNi:19}. Also, in this proof, all the boundary-value problems involved included a zero Dirichlet condition on the scatterer $\GD;$ we omit this throughout the proof for brevity.

By applying the Helmholtz operator to the formal series \eqref{eq:formalseriesv} we obtain the following problems for $\vj \in \HjptD, j \geq 1$:
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vz\mright) = -f \quad\tand\quad \dn \vz = \gI,
\eeqs
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vo\mright) = 0\quad\tand\quad\dn \vo = i\vz,
\eeqs
and, for $j \in \mleft[2,p-2\mright]$
\beq\label{eq:vj}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \vj\mright) = - n\vjmt\quad\tand\quad\dn \vz = i\vjmo.
\eeq

By \cref{thm:shift} we immediately conclude the bound
\beq\label{eq:expuz}
\NHtD{\vz} \leq \CAz\Cfg \leq \Cefn{0}\Cfg,
\eeq
and by \cref{lem:domainshift,eq:expuz} we can conclude the bound
\beqs
\NHthD{\vo} \leq \CAo \mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)\NHtD{i\vz} \leq \max\set{1,\CAo}\mleft(1+\CTrfn{2}\mright)\Cefn{0} \Cfg = \Cefn{1}\Cfg.
\eeqs

We prove the bound \cref{eq:expansionuj} by induction; suppose \cref{eq:expansionuj} holds for all $s \in [0,j-1].$ Using \cref{lem:domainshift}, we conclude that (using the observation that $\Cefn{j-1} \geq \Cefn{j-2}$)
\begin{align*}
\NHfn{j+2}{D}{\vj} &\leq \CAj \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\mleft(\NLiD{n} \NHfn{j}{D}{\vfn{j-2}} + \NHfn{j+1}{D}{\vfn{j-1}}\mright)\\
&\leq \max\set{1,\CAj} \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\mleft(\NLiD{n} \Cefn{j-2} \Pfn{j-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright) + \Cefn{j-1} \Pfn{j-1}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mright)\Cfg\\
&\leq 2\max\set{1,\CAj} \mleft(1+\CTrjpo\mright)\Cefn{j-1} \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n})\Cfg\\
&= \Cefn{j} \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n})\Cfg.
\end{align*}
%% Therefore the definition of the polynomials $\Pj$ \cref{eq:pjdef} holds (and it is straightforward to see that $\deg\mleft(\Pj\mright) = \deg\mleft(\Pfn{j-2}\mright)+1$, where $\deg$ denotes polynomial degree, and therefore since $\deg\mleft(\Pfn{0}\mright) = \deg\mleft(\Pfn{1}\mright)=0,$ \cref{eq:polydegree} holds. Hence, by the relationship between $\usj$ and $\vj$, we have the bound \cref{eq:expansionuj}.

We will now define the remainders $\rl$, and proceed similarly.
Let $\ro \in \HthD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \ro\mright) = -k^2 u
\eeqs
\beqs
\dn \ro = iku.
\eeqs
Then by \cref{lem:domainshift}
\beqs%gin{align*}
\NHthD{\ro} \leq \CAo\mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)\mleft(k^2\NHoD{u} + k\NHtD{u}\mright)\leq \CAo\mleft(1+\CTrt\mright)k^2\CAnk\Cfg\leq \frac{\Cefn{1}}{\max\set{1,\CAo}}.
\eeqs%nd{align*}
Let $\rt \in \HfD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \rt\mright) = -k^2 u
\eeqs
\beqs
\dn \rt = ik\ro.
\eeqs
Then by \cref{lem:domainshift}
\begin{align*}
\NHfD{\rt} &\leq \CAt\mleft(1+\CTrth\mright)\mleft(k^2\NHtD{u} + k\NHthD{\ro}\mright)\\
&\leq \CAt\mleft(1+\CTrth\mright)\mleft(1 + \frac{\Cefn{1}}{\max\set{1,\CAo}}\mright)\CAnk k^3\Cfg\leq \frac{\Cefn{2}}{\max\set{1,\CAo}}.
\end{align*}
Then for $j \geq 3,$ let $\rj \in \HjptD$ solve
\beqs
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \rt\mright) = -k^2 \rjmt
\eeqs
\beqs
\dn \rj = ik\rjmo.
\eeqs
And by induction and \cref{lem:domainshift} again, letting $\uosc = \rfn{p-1},$ we have \cref{eq:expansionuosc}. It is straightforward to see that $\rfn{p-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{p-2} \uj$ solves \cref{prob:tedp}, and therefore \cref{eq:expansionid} holds, as $u$ is unique.
\epf
%\{Just a note while I think about it - could you do DtN boundary conditions in this proof by testing with a different function when wanting to bound the $L^2$ norm on the boundary? I wonder if testing with the NtD of $u$ would mean you end up with a $\LtGI{u}^2$ term, and then you could use properties of the NtD map to bound other bits. Might foil $k$-dependency though.}
Using the expansion in \cref{thm:expansion}, we can prove the following error bound for the best approximation of $u$ in $\Vhp$:

%% We also have the following best-approximation error in higer-order Sobolev spaces:

\beq\label{eq:bestapproxL2}
\NLtD{u-\uhhat} \leq \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMo  h^2 + \CFEMt \CAnk h\mleft(hk\mright)^p \mright)\Cfg,

\ele

%We write bounds for the standard and weighted $H^1$ norms separately, as we will use each individual bound in differents of proofs in \cref{sec:fembound}.

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:bestapprox}]
We apply \cref{lem:scottzhang} to all the $\usj$ and $\uosc$ in \cref{thm:expansion}, and obtain that there exist $\ujh,$ $j=0,\ldots,p-2$ and $\uosch$ in $\Vhp$ such that 
\beqs
\NLtD{\usj - \ujh} + h\NHoD{\usj - \ujh} \leq \Cinterpfn{j+2} \Cefn{j} \Pj\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright) h^{j+2}k^j \Cfg

\NLtD{\uosc - \uosch} + h\NHoD{\uosc - \uosch} \leq \Cinterpfn{p+1} \Cosc\CAnk h^{p+1}k^p \Cfg.

Therefore, by letting $\uhhat = \uosch + \sum_{j=0}^{p-2} \ujh,$ we have \cref{eq:bestapproxL2,eq:bestapproxW} (using the fact that $hk \leq 1$ and, as $\NLiD{n} \geq 1$, $\Pfn{p-2}(\NLiD{n}) \geq \Pfn{j}(\NLiD{n}) \geq 1$ for all $j \leq p-2$).

\subsection{Error bounds for simple Galerkin projections}\label{sec:errgalerkin}
In this \lcnamecref{sec:errgalerkin} we state a sequence of error bounds in negative Sobolev norms for three different projection operators. The proofs of these error bounds are all simple modifications of the standard proofs of finite-element errors in negative Sobolev norms, as in, e.g., \cite[Theorem 5.8.3]{BrSc:08},  and so we only prove \cref{lem:wltdprojerr,lem:ellprojerrw} below, as these are the proofs that deviate most from the standard proof.
%\ednote{Both-should I write out at least one of these modified proofs?}. % Note to self, I have these proofs sketched out, but just use the argument from Brenner and Scott and use an L^2 inner product on the function, not their gradients, for the elliptic projection.
We first define the projections we use.

Define the elliptic projection $\Ph:\HozDD\rightarrow\Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
\beqs
\IPLtD{A\grad\vh}{\grad\Ph w} = \IPLtD{A\grad\vh}{\grad w} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
\eeqs
%% and define the weighted elliptic projection $\Phn:\HozDD\rightarrow\Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
%% \beqs
%% \IPLtD{A\grad\vh}{\grad\Phn w} = \IPLtDn{A\grad\vh}{\grad w} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
%% \eeqs

Observe that $\Ph w$ is the finite-element solution of a stationary diffusion problem with `diffusion coefficient' $A$ and a right-hand side in $\HozDD'.$

We define the $\LtD$-projection $\Qh:\HozDD\rightarrow \Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
\beqs
\IPLtD{\Qh w}{\vh} = \IPLtD{w}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
\eeqs

We also need to define the $\LtD$ projection in a norm weighted by $n$

For $v,w \in \LtD,$ define the $n$-weighted inner product
\beqs
\IPLtDn{v}{w} = \int_{D} n v \wbar,
\eeqs
and the corresponding $n$-weighted $\LtD$ norm $\NLtDn{v} = \sqrt{\int_{D} n \abs{v}^2}$.

For $s \in \NN$, we define the $n$-weighted $\HmD$ norms $\NHmDn{v}^2 = \sum_{\alpha \st \abs{\alpha} \leq s}\NLtDn{D^\alpha v}$, and the negative weighted Sobolev norms by
\beq\label{eq:negweightnorm}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{v} = \sup_{w \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{v}{w}}{\NHmDn{w}}.
\eeq
Observe that, for $v \in \HmD,$
\beq\label{eq:nconv}
\nmin\NHmD{v} \leq \NHmDn{v} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHmD{v}.
\eeq
%We put the \emph{non-weighted} $H^s$-norm in the denominator of \cref{eq:negweightnorm}, but the \emph{weighted} inner product in the numerator for ease of manipulation in some of the following proofs---we could place the weighted $H^s$ norm in the denominator, and this would be equivalent to the current definition, up to a factor involving $n$.
%% so that we have, for all $v \in \LtD$
%% \beq\label{eq:neqweightid}
%% \NHmsD{n v} = \NHmsDn{v}.
%% \eeq
%% \beq\label{eq:negativeweightbounds}
%% \frac{\NHmsD{v}}{\NLiD{n}} \leq \NHmsDn{v} \leq \frac{NHmsD{v}}{\nmin}.
%% \eeq

Define the $\LtD$ projection in the $n$-weighted norm $\Qhn:\HozDD\rightarrow \Vhp$ by, for $w \in \HozDD$
\beqs
\IPLtDn{\Qhn w}{\vh} = \IPLtDn{w}{\vh} \tforall \vh \in \Vhp.
\eeqs

We now state and prove our error bounds. These can all be obtained by modifications of the proof in \cite[Theorem 5.8.3]{BrSc:08} because all the projections defined above are Galerkin projections given by coercive and bounded sesquilinear forms on $\HoD$ (for $\Ph$) or $\LtD$ (for $\Qh$ and $\Qhn$).\optodo{Check if $\Qh$ is used.}

The elliptic projection obeys the following error bounds:

For the case $m \geq 1$, let $\phi \in \HmD,$ and observe that by \cref{thm:banachalg} $n\phi\in \HmD$ also. Let $ \vtilde = \sdsol(\phi),$ observe\ednote{$\Sn$ is defined in \cref{sec:discsob}---I haven't yet decided where to put the definition.} that by \cref{ass:highp,thm:shift} $\vtilde \in \Hfn{}{s+2}{D}$. For all $v \in \HozDD,$ we have
\beqs
\IPLtD{A \grad \vtilde}{\grad v} = \IPLtD{n\phi}{v} = \IPLtDn{\phi}{v}.
\eeqs
If we take $v = w-\Ph w,$ then we can compute
\begin{align}
\IPLtDn{\phi}{v} &= \IPLtD{A\grad\mleft(\vtilde - \vh\mright)}{\grad\mleft(w-\Ph w\mright)} \text{ for } \vh \text{ the quasi-interpolant of } v\text{, by Galerkin orthogonality for } \Ph\nonumber\\

\end{align}

For $m > d/2,$ and so by \cref{thm:banachalg,eq:nconv}, \cref{eq:ellprojwpart} is bounded above by
\beq\label{eq:wep1pt0}
\CSZfn{s+2} \CAfn{s} \CBanfn{s} \NLiDop{A} \frac{\NHfn{s}{D}{n}}{\nmin}\NHnfn{s}{D}{\phi} h^{s+1}\SNHoD{w-\Ph w}.
\eeq


Therefore we have, by definition of $\NHnfn{-s}{D}{\cdot}$ and $\NHoDn{\cdot}$,
\beq\label{eq:wep1pt1}
\NHnfn{-s}{D}{w-\Ph w} \leq \CSZfn{s+2}\CAfn{s} \CBanfn{s} \NLiDop{A} \frac{\NHmD{n}}{\nmin^2} h^{s+1} \NHoDn{w - \Ph w}.
\eeq
Applying C\'ea's Lemma to $\Ph$ in the $n$-weighted $H^1$ norm, we find
\beq\label{eq:wepcea}
\NHoDn{w-\Ph w} \leq \frac{2\NLiDop{A}}{\min\set{1,1/\CP^2}\Amin}\nvar\BAHoDn{w}{\wh},
\eeq
as $\Ph$ corresponds to a sesquilinear form that is bounded with constant $\NLiDop{A}/\nmin$ and coercive with constant $\mleft(\Amin\min\set{1,1/\CP}\mright)/\mleft(2\NLiD{n}\mright)$ in the $n$-weighted $H^1$ norm.
and then combining \cref{eq:wep1pt1,eq:wepcea}, we obtain \cref{eq:errn} in the case $m > d/2$.

For $s \in [1,d/2],$ the application of \cref{thm:banachalg} yields, instead of \cref{eq:wep1pt0},
\beq\label{eq:wep2pt1}

\eeq
(since $1 + \NWsiD{n} \leq 2\NWsiD{n},$ as $\NLiD{n} \geq 1$) and by a similar reasoning to that before, we obtain \cref{eq:errn}, in the case $m \in [1,d/2]$.

For the case $m=0,$, using \cref{lem:ellprojerr} and then converting to the $n$-weighted $L^2$ norm yields \cref{eq:errn}. For $m=-1,$, \cref{eq:wepcea} immediately gives \cref{eq:errn}.

\subsection{Discrete Sobolev spaces}\label{sec:discsob}
In order to perform our analysis for high-order FEM, we will need to measure higher-order norms of functions in the finite-element space $\Vhp.$ However, as these functions do not have higher-order weak derivatives, we must first develop some theory of so-called discrete Sobolev spaces; we follow the presentation in \cite{DuWu:15}, albeit working in the heterogeneous case, and with some changes of notation.

We let $\DeltaAI:\LtD\rightarrow\HtD$ denote the solution operator for the stationary diffusion equation: given $\ftilde \in \LtD$ find $\utilde \in \HtD$ such that
\beq\label{eq:sdeq}
\grad \cdot \mleft(A\grad \utilde\mright) = -n\ftilde \text{ in } D

%% hence $\DeltaA:\DomainDeltaA \rightarrow \LtD.$ Observe that, for any $f \in \LtD$ there exists $\wf \in \DomainDeltaA$ such that $\DeltaA \wf = -f.$
Observe that $\sdsol$ is well-defined by \cref{lem:domainshift}. Also, observe that $\sdsol^{m}$ is defined\optodo{more here} for any $m \in \NN,$ as $\HtD \subseteq \LtD,$ and so one can place $\sdsol \ftilde$ on the right-hand side.

\beqs

\bre[Why the factor $n$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq}?]\label{rem:why}
The reason for defining $\Sn$ with a factor $n$ on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq} is somewhat buried in the proof of \cref{thm:fembound} and its associated lemmas. However, we give an overview of the reason here.

All the bounds in the proofs of \cref{lem:boundarybound,lem:higherbound,lem:ltthetahbound} are in weighted discrete norms, because we can only prove bounds on the weighted $L^2$ projection $\Qhn$ in weighted higher-order discrete norms (as in \cref{lem:wltdprojerr}), not in non-weighted norms. Because we only work in weighted norms, we need \cref{lem:intoip} below to hold in the weighted inner product, which necessitates that we use the weighted inner product on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:discderdef}. This final use of the weighted inner product means we must have the weighted inner product on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:deltaagreen} so that we can show (at the beginning of the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}) that if $\wh \in \Vhp,$ $\zh = \Deltah^{-1} \wh$, and $z = \Sn \wh,$ then $\zh = \Ph z;$ we need this fact in the remainder of the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}.

We do not, however, put a factor $n$ on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq}. If we did, when we apply \cref{thm:shift} to $\Sn \ftilde$ (as we do in \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}), the resulting bounds would not be fully explicit in $n$ (because in \cref{thm:shift} we do not know explicitly how the constants depend on the `diffusion coefficient'). Not putting a factor $n$ on the left-hand side of \cref{eq:sdeq} is the reason why there is a \emph{non-weighted} inner product on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:discderdef} (so that the beginning of the proof of \cref{lem:negdiscsum}, as mentioned above, works).

\ble[Discrete derivative operator is well-defined]\label{lem:ddwd}

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:ddwd}]
If one chooses an orthonormal (in the $n$-weighted inner product) basis  $\phij$ for $\Vhp,$ writes $\Delta\wh = \sum_j \wj \phij$, and takes $\vh = \phij$ for each $j,$ then we see \cref{eq:discderdef} is equivalent to the linear system $\Imat \bw = \bb,$ where $\bb_{j} = \IPLtDn{A \grad \wh}{\grad \phij}.$ The solution of this linear system clearly exists and is unique.
%% We equip $\Vhp$ with the $H^1$-norm. Observe that $\Deltah \wh$ satisfies the variational problem: Find $\vhtilde  \in \Vhp$ such that $\add(\uh,\vh) = \Ldd(\vh)$ for all $\vh \in \Vhp,$ where $\add(\uh,\vh) = \IPLtD{\uh}{\vh}$ and $\Ldd(\vh) = \IPLtD{A \grad \wh}{\grad \vh}.$ Observe that $\Ldd$ is bounded in $\Vhp$, as $\Ldd(\vh) \leq \NLiDop{A} \SNHoD{\wh}\SNHoD{\vh} \leq \NLiDop{A} \SNHoD{\wh}\NHoD{\vh},$ and $\add$ is coercive on $\Vhp,$ as, for $\vh \in \Vhp$, $\add(\vh,\vh) = \NLtD{\vh}^2 \geq \CinvVhp^2 \NHoD{\vh}^2$ by the standard inverse estimate\optodo{Add in?}. Therefore, by the Lax--Milgram Theorem applied in $\Vhp$ (as $\Vhp$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space over a complete field, it is a Hilbert space), $\Deltah \wh$ exists and is unique.

\eeqs
We use the notation $\Rn = \max\set{\shiftn{m}\st m = -1,\ldots,p-1}.$

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}]
We first observe that the operator $\sdsolo$ is self-adjoint on $\LtD$: Let $\DeltaA:\HtD\rightarrow\LtD$ denote the stationary diffusion operator $\grad\cdot\mleft(A\grad\cdot\mright).$ Then for any $\vo \in \LtD,$ $\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vo = \vo.$ Moreover, by Green's Theorem, $\DeltaA$ is self-adjoint on the set $\set{v \in \HtD \st v \text{ satisfies }\cref{eq:sddbc,eq:sdnbc}},$ this set is contained in the image of $\sdsolo.$ Therefore, for any $\vo,\vt \in \LtD,$ we have
\beqs
\IPLtD{\sdsolo \vo}{\vt} =\IPLtD{\sdsolo \vo}{\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vt} = \IPLtD{\DeltaA \circ \sdsolo \vo}{\sdsolo \vt} = \IPLtD{\vo}{\sdsolo \vt},
\eeqs
i.e., $\sdsolo$ is self-adjoint on $\LtD.$

Observe that by \cref{thm:banachalg}, if $v \in \HmD$ then $nv \in \HmD,$ and therefore by \cref{thm:shift} $\sdsolo(nv) \in \HmptD.$ With these facts in place we can compute
\begin{align*}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\sdsol \ftilde} &= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{\sdsol \ftilde}{nv}}{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{\sdsolo\mleft(n \ftilde\mright)}{nv}}{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{\ftilde}{\sdsolo\mleft(n v\mright)}}{\NHmDn{v}}\tas \sdsolo \text{ is self-adjoint}\\
&\leq \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}\NHnfn{m+2}{D}{\sdsolo\mleft(nv\mright)} }{\NHmDn{v}}\\
&\leq \sup_{v \in \HmD}  \frac{\CAfn{m} \NLiD{n} \NHmD{nv} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}}{\NHmDn{v}}
%% & = \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtD{ n\ftilde}{\sdsol(v)}}{\NHmD{v}}\text{ by definition of } \sdsol, \text{ and as } \sdsolo \text{ is self-adjoint}\\
%% &= \sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\IPLtDn{\ftilde}{\frac{\sdsol(nv)}n}}{\NHmD{v}}\\
%% &\leq \CBanfn{m+2}\sup_{v \in \HmD} \frac{\NHfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\ftilde}\NHfn{m+2}{D}{\sdsol(nv)}\NHfn{m+2}{D}{\frac1n}}{\NHmD{v}} \text{ by \cref{thm:banachalg}}\\

\end{align*}
and by applying \cref{thm:banachalg} to the term $\NHfn{m}{D}{nv}$ (or observing that $\NLtD{nv} \leq \NLiD{n}\NLtD{v}$, in the case $m=0$), the result follows, except for $m=-1.$

For $m=-1,$ we have, by the Lax--Milgram Theorem in non-weighted norms, $\NHoD{\Sn \ftilde} \leq \NHmoD{n\ftilde}/\Amin.$ One can straightforwardly show that $\NHnfn{1}{D}{\Sn \ftilde} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHoD{\Sn \ftilde}$ and $\NHmoD{n\ftilde} \leq \NLiD{n} \NHnfn{-1}{D}{\ftilde},$ and so the result follows.

Let $\wh \in \Vhp,$ and define $\zh = \DeltahI \wh,$ $z = \DeltaAI \wh$ (observe $z$ is well-defined as $\Vhp \subseteq \LtD$). Then, for all $\vh \in \Vhp$, we have

\begin{align*}
\IPLtD{A \grad z}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtD{A \grad \mleft(\sdsol \wh\mright)}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtDn{\wh}{\vh} \text{, and}\\
\IPLtD{A \grad \zh}{\grad \vh} = \IPLtDn{\Deltah \zh}{\vh} = \IPLtDn{\wh}{\vh},
\end{align*}
where the equalities in the first line follow from the definition of $z$ and \cref{eq:deltaagreen}, and the equalities in the second line follows from \cref{eq:discderdef} and the definition of $\zh.$  Therefore (using the fact that $A$ is symmetric), for all $\vh \in \Vhp,$ $\IPLtD{A\grad \vh}{\grad z} = \IPLtD{A\grad \vh}{\grad \zh},$ i.e., $\zh = \Ph z.$

We now have, for $m \in [-1,p-1]$
\begin{align}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\DeltahI \wh} &\leq \NHnfn{-m}{D}{z} + \NHnfn{-m}{D}{z-\zh}\nonumber\\

\end{align}
by \cref{lem:shiftnegativew}, where we use $\shiftn{m}$ to denote the terms depending on $n$ in \cref{eq:shiftnegativew}.
From \cref{eq:sumforrecursion}, we can conclude that, for $l \in \NN$ and $\vh \in \Vhp$, writing $\wh = \Deltahmlpo \vh$,
\beq\label{eq:lrecursion}
\NHnfn{-m}{D}{\Deltahml \vh} \leq \Cshiftfn{m}\shiftn{m} \NHnfn{-(m+2)}{D}{\Deltahmlpo \vh} + \Cm \errn{m} \frac{\NLiD{n}}{\nmin} h^{m+2} \NLtDn{\Deltahmlpo \vh}
\eeq
as $\Deltahml = \DeltahI \Deltahmlpo$. We now use \cref{eq:lrecursion} recursively to bound $\Nfn{j,h,n}{\vh}$.

If $j = 2l,$ then one can show inductively using \cref{eq:lrecursion} that for any integer $t \in [0,l]$ that
\beq\label{eq:evenrecursivesum}
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} \leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^t\sum_{m=0}^t \Efn{m,t} h^{2m} \NHDfn{-2(t-m)}{\vh} ,
\eeq
\optodo{Fix creflabelformat for equations in subscripts}
where we define the $\Efn{m,t}$ inductively by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Emt1}\Efn{0,0} &=1\\
\label{eq:Emt2}\Efn{m,t} &= \Cshiftfn{2(t-1-m)} \Efn{m,t-1} \tfor 0 \leq m \leq t-1 \quad\tand\\
\label{eq:Emt3}\Efn{t,t} &= \sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Csumrecfn{2(t-1-m)} \Efn{m,t-1}.
\end{align}
To see this recurrence, we prove the inductive step: suppose
\beqs
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} \leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{t-1}\sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Efn{m,t-1} h^{2m} \NHDfn{-2(t-1-m)}{\vh}.
\eeqs
Then using \cref{eq:lrecursion}, we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{-2l,h,n}{\vh} &\leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{t-1}\sum_{m=0}^{t-1} \Efn{m,t-1} h^{2m} \mleft(\Cshiftfn{2(t-1-m)}\shiftn{2(t-1-m)} \NHnfn{-(2(t-1-m)+2}{D}{\Deltah^{-l+t} \vh}\mright.\\
&\quad\quad\mleft.+ \Csumrecfn{2(t-1-m)} \errn{2(t-1-m)} \nvar h^{2(t-1-m)+2} \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-l+t} \vh}\mright),
\end{align*}
which upon rearranging, and using the fact that $\shiftn{2(t-1-m)} \leq \errn{2(t-1-m)}$ and $\nvar \geq 1,$ yields \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum}, with the recurrence \cref{eq:Emt1,eq:Emt2,eq:Emt3}.

If $j=2l+1,$ then we first reduce $\Nfn{-j,h}{\vh}$ to a point analagous to the even case, and then proceed as before. Let $\wh$ and $\zh$ be as at the beginning of the proof, and let $z$ solve the variational formulation\footnote{We use the variational formulation here, as we will need to bound the $H^1$-norm of $z$ by the $H^{-1}$-norm of $\wh$, which is immediate from the Lax--Milgram theorem.}  of \cref{eq:sdeq,eq:sddbc,eq:sdnbc} (with $\ftilde = \wh$). Observe that we still have $\zh = \Ph z,$ and

\beq\label{eq:LMHmo}
\NHfn{1}{D}{z} \leq \frac1{\Amin} \NHfn{-1}{D}{n\wh}
\eeq
by the Lax--Milgram Theorem. We have
\begin{align}
\NLtDn{\Deltah^{-1/2}\wh} &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{1/2} \zh}\nonumber\\
&= \IPLtDn{\Deltah \zh}{\zh} \text{ by \cref{eq:feiptrans}}\\

\end{align}
We now return to
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{j,h,n}{\vh} &= \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-l-1/2} \vh} = \NLtDn{\Deltah^{-1/2} \Deltah^{-l} \vh}\\
&\leq \frac{\mleft(1+\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\NLiDop{A}}{\Amin}\NLiD{n}\NHnfn{-1}{D}{\Deltah^{-l}\vh}
\end{align*}
by \cref{eq:deltahhalf}.

Similarly to \cref{eq:evenrecursivesum}, one can use \cref{eq:lrecursion} recursively to show that, for any integer $t \in [0,l]$
\beq\label{eq:oddrecursive}

\eeq
where  we define the $\Etildefn{m,t}$ inductively, for $t \in [0,l]$ by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Etilde1}\Etildefn{0,0} &= 1\\
%\label{eq:Etilde2}\Etildefn{1,1} &= \Csumrecfn{1}\\
\label{eq:Etilde3}\Etildefn{0,t} &= \Etildefn{0,t-1}\Cshiftfn{2(t-1)+1)}\\

\end{align}
To show \cref{eq:oddrecursive,eq:Etilde1,eq:Etilde3,eq:Etilde4,eq:Etilde5}, observe that \cref{eq:Etilde1} is immediate; we now show \cref{eq:oddrecursive,eq:Etilde3,eq:Etilde4,eq:Etilde5} by induction: suppose %\cref{eq:oddrecursive} holds for $t-1,$ then
\beqs

\subsection{Main finite-element-error bound}\label{sec:fembound}

Having established the need results on discrete Sobolev spaces, we are now in a position to prove our main theorem, \cref{thm:fembound}, which we do via a series of lemmas.

Two quantities that are key in the proof are
\beqs
\rho \de u - \Ph u, \tand
\eeqs
\beqs
\thetah \de \Ph u - \uh.
\eeqs
The main idea of the proof is to decompose the error $u - \uh = \rho + \thetah,$ use bounds on the elliptic projection operator to bound $\rho,$ and then bound $\thetah$ (in higher-order discrete norms) in terms of $\rho.$

The following \lcnamecref{lem:simpleform} sets up the argument in the lemmas that follow.
\ble[Expression for $a(\thetah,\vh)$]\label{lem:simpleform}
For any $\vh \in \Vhp,$
\beq\label{eq:thetaform}
a(\thetah,\vh) = k^2\IPLtDn{\Qhn\rho}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.
\eeq
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:simpleform}]
Let $\vh \in \Vhp.$ Then $a(\thetah,\vh) = a(u-\uh,\vh) - a(\rho,\vh) = -a(\rho,\vh)$ by Galerkin orthogonality. By definition of $a,$ we have $-a(\rho,\vh) = -\IPLtD{A\grad\mleft(u-\Ph u\mright)}{\vh} + k^2 \IPLtD{n\rho}{\vh} + ik\IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.$ By Galerkin orthogonality for the elliptic projection, $\IPLtD{A\grad\mleft(u-\Ph u\mright)}{\vh} = 0$, and so by the definition of the $n$-weighted $L^2$ inner product, and the $n$-weighted $L^2$-projection $\Qhn,$ the result follows.
\epf

\ble[Bound on $\NLtGI{\thetah}$ by $\Npmoh{\thetah}$]\label{lem:boundarybound}
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound}, we have
\beq\label{eq:boundarybound}
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq \Cboundaryo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{2\mleft(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1\mright)}\NLiD{n}^4 k^2 h^{2p-1} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2 + \Cboundaryt h \NW{\rho}^2,
\eeq
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:boundarybound}]
In \cref{eq:thetaform}, let $\vh = \thetah,$ and take the imaginary part to obtain
\beq\label{eq:boundboundarybelow}
-k \NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq \Im k^2 \IPLtDn{\Qhn \rho}{\thetah} + \Re k \IPLtGI{\rho}{\thetah},
\eeq
and therefore by \cref{cor:ipdiscbound}
\beq
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq  k \Nfn{1-p,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah}.\label{eq:thetaboundarypart}
%% \nonumber\\
%% &\leq  k \NLiD{n}^2 \Nfn{1-p,h}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{p-1,h}{\thetah} + \NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah}
\eeq
We first bound the negative norm $\Nfn{1-p,h}{\Qhn\rho}$, to do this we use \cref{lem:negdiscsum}; however, we therefore need to estimate negative Sobolev norms of $\Qhn\rho$; for integers $m \in [0,p-1]$ we have (observing that $\Qhn \Ph u = \Ph u$ as $\Ph u \in \Vhp.$
\begin{align}
\NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn\rho} &\leq \NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn u - u} + \NHnfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{u - \Ph u}\nonumber\\
&\leq \CSZfn{(p-1-m)} \nvar h^{(p-1-m)} \NLtDn{u-\Ph u} + \Cwfn{-(p-1-m)}\errn{(p-1-m)} h^{p-m} \NHoDn{u - \Ph u}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw,lem:wltdprojerr}, taking } \wh = \Ph u \text{ in \cref{lem:ellprojerrw,eq:wltdprojerr}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \mleft(\CSZfn{(p-1-m)} \Cwz + \Cwfn{-(p-1-m)}\mright)\En\nvar\NLiD{n} h^{p-m} \NW{\rho} \text{ by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw}}\label{eq:Qhnrhoneg}
\end{align}
By \cref{lem:negdiscsum,eq:Qhnrhoneg} we have
\begin{align}
\Nfn{1-p,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}&\leq \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}}\NLiD{n} \Csumfn{p-1} \sum_{m=0}^{p-1} h^{m} \NHfn{-(p-1-m)}{D}{\Qhn \rho} \nonumber\\
&\leq \Cmess \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \NW{\rho}.\label{eq:Qhnrhosum}
\end{align}
To deal with the second term on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:thetaboundarypart} we use \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:ellprojerr}, taking $\wh = \Ph u$ in \cref{eq:ellprojerr} and the fact that $\NHoD{\cdot} \leq \NW{\cdot}$ to obtain
\beq\label{eq:rhomtbound}
\NLtGI{\rho} \leq \CMT\NHoD{\rho}^{1/2}\NLtD{\rho}^{1/2} \leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^\half \NHoD{\rho}\leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^{\half} \NW{\rho}.
\eeq
Therefore by \cref{eq:rhomtbound} and Young's inequality, we obtain
\beq\label{eq:rhothetamt}
\NLtGI{\rho}\NLtGI{\thetah} \leq \half \CMT^2 \Cprojfn{0} h \NW{\rho}^2 + \half \NLtGI{\thetah}^2.
\eeq
By combining \cref{eq:thetaboundarypart,eq:Qhnrhosum,eq:rhothetamt} we have
\beq\label{eq:thetahboundnear}
\NLtGI{\thetah}^2 \leq k \Cmess \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 h^p \NW{\rho}\Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \half \CMT^2 \Cprojfn{0} h\NW{\rho}^2 + \half \NLtGI{\thetah}^2
\eeq
By using Young's inequality on the first term in \cref{eq:thetahboundnear}, and moving the $\NLtGI{\thetah}^2$ term onto the left-hand side, we obtain \cref{eq:boundarybound}.
\epf

\ble[Bound on higher-order discrete norms of $\thetah$ by $\NLtD{\thetah}$]\label{lem:higherbound}
Under the assumptions of \cref{thm:fembound}, for integer $m \in [1,p]$ there exist constants $\Chighmo,$ $\Chighmt > 0$ such that
\begin{align}
\Nfn{m,h,n}{\thetah} &\leq \Chighmo \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)^mk^m \NLtD{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ \Chighmt \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m} \NW{\rho}.\label{eq:chigh}
\end{align}
\ele
\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:higherbound}]
By inserting the definitions of $a$ and $\Deltah$ in \cref{eq:thetaform} and rearranging, we have for any $\vh \in \Vhp$
\beqs
\IPLtDn{\Deltah \thetah}{\vh} = k^2 \IPLtDn{\thetah}{\vh} + k^2\IPLtDn{\Qhn \rho}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\thetah}{\vh} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\vh}.
\eeqs
Therefore, if we take $\vh = \Deltah^{m-1}\thetah$, by \cref{lem:intoip} we have
\beq\label{eq:deltahm}
\Nfn{m,h,n}{\thetah}^2 = k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2 + k^2 \IPLtDn{\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2} \Qhn \rho}{\Deltah^{\frac{m-1}2}\thetah} + ik\IPLtGI{\thetah}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah} + ik \IPLtGI{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah}.
\eeq
We now proceed to bound the two terms in \cref{eq:deltahm} defined on the truncation boundary $\GI.$ For the first term, we have
\begin{align}
\IPLtGI{\thetah}{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah} &\leq \NLtGI{\thetah}\NLtGI{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \NLtGI{\thetah} h^{-\half} \NLtD{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:inverseinequality}}\nonumber\\
&= \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} h^{-\half}\NLtGI{\thetah}\nmin^{-1}\Nfn{2m-2,h,n}{\thetah}\text{ by the definition of }\Nfn{2m-2,h,n}{\cdot}\nonumber\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1} h^{-m+\half} \nmin^{-m} \NLtGI{\thetah}\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah} \text{ by \cref{lem:inversediscrete} applied } m-1 \text{ times}\label{eq:useitagain}\\
&\leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1} h^{-m+\half} \nmin^{-m}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\mleft(\Cboundaryo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2 k h^{p-\half} \Nfn{p-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \Cboundaryt^{\half} h^{\half} \NW{\rho}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\text{ by \cref{lem:boundarybound} and \cref{eq:simple}}\nonumber\\
&\leq \mleft(\CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p}k \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \CBt \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NW{\rho}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\label{eq:firstboundary}
\end{align}
by \cref{lem:inversediscrete} applied $p-m$ times.
To bound the second boundary term in \cref{eq:deltahm}, we have
\beq\label{eq:secondboundarytemp}
\IPLtGI{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1} \thetah} \leq \CMT \CinvVhp^{1/2} \Chinv^{m-1}\nmin^{-m}h^{\half-m}\Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}\NLtGI{\rho}
\eeq
using the same reasoning as we used to obtain \cref{eq:useitagain} above. By \cref{thm:multiplicativetrace,lem:ellprojerr} (with $\wh = \Ph u$) we have
\beq\label{eq:secondboundarytemp2}
\NLtGI{\rho} \leq \CMT \Cprojfn{0}^{\half} h^{\half} \NW{\rho}.
\eeq

Inserting \cref{eq:secondboundarytemp2} into \cref{eq:secondboundarytemp} we obtain
\beq\label{eq:secondboundary}
\IPLtD{\rho}{\Deltah^{m-1}\thetah} \leq \CBth \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NW{\rho} \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}.
\eeq

Therefore, from \cref{eq:deltahm,eq:firstboundary,eq:secondboundary} and the Cauchy--Schwartz inequality, we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah}^2 &\leq k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}^2 + k^2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ k\mleft(\CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p}k \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah} + \CBt \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NW{\rho}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ k\CBth \nmin^{-m}h^{1-m} \NW{\rho} \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah}%\label{eq:thetahighnearlynearly}.
\end{align*}
Therefore using Young's inequality we have
\begin{align*}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah}^2 &\leq k^2\mleft(\frac32 + \CBo \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nmin^{-p} + \half \CBt \nmin^{-m} + \half\CBth \nmin^{-m}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}^2\\
&\quad\quad+ \frac{k^2}2 \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}^2 +  h^{2(1-m)} \NW{\rho}^2,
\end{align*}
and therefore by \cref{eq:simple}
\begin{align}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah} &\leq k\mleft(\sqrt{\frac32} + \CBo^{\half} \mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2} + \frac1{\sqrt{2}} \CBt^{\half} \nmin^{-\frac{m}2} + \frac1{\sqrt{2}}\CBth^{\half} \nmin^{-\frac{m}2}\mright)\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\thetah}\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad+ \frac{k}{\sqrt{2}} \Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho} +  h^{1-m} \NW{\rho},\label{eq:thetahighnearly}
\end{align}

We now proceed to bound $\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho}$: By \cref{lem:inversediscrete} and the fact that $\Qhn \Ph u = \Ph u$ (as $\Ph u \in \Vhp$), we have
\beq\label{eq:qhnmmo}
\Nfn{m-1,h,n}{\Qhn \rho} \leq \Chinv^{m-1} \nmin^{1-m}h^{1-m} \mleft(\NLtDn{\Qhn u - u} + \NLtDn{u-\Ph u}\mright).
\eeq

Using \cref{lem:wltdprojerr} we can bound the first of these terms by the second, $\NLtDn{\Qhn u - u} \leq \CSZfn{0} \nvar \NLtDn{u-\Ph u}.$ We can also bound $\NLtDn{u - \Ph u} \leq \Cwfn{0} \nvar^3h \NHnfn{1}{D}{\rho} \leq \Cwfn{0} \nvar^3\NLiD{n} h \NW{\rho}$ by \cref{lem:ellprojerrw}. Therefore by \cref{eq:qhnmmo} we have (as $kh \leq 1$ and $\nvar \geq 1$)
\beq\label{eq:qhnnearly}
k \Nfn{m-1,h}{\Qhn \rho} \leq \Chinv^{m-1}\Cwz \mleft(1+\CSZfn{0}\mright)\nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m}\NW{\rho}.
\eeq
Therefore using \cref{eq:thetahighnearly,eq:qhnnearly} (and the fact that $\NLiD{n}, \nmin^{-1} \geq 1,$ and so $\En, \nvar \geq1$)  we have

\beq\label{eq:readytorecurse}
\Nfn{m,h}{\thetah} \leq \CRecofn{m} \mleft(1+\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)k \Nfn{m-1,h}{\thetah} + \CRect \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{1-m} h^{1-m} \NW{\rho}.
\eeq
Using \cref{eq:readytorecurse} recursively, and the facts that $\nmin^{-1} \geq 1$ and $hk \leq 1,$ we obtain \cref{eq:chigh}.

\end{align}
\ele

\bpf[Proof of \cref{lem:ltthetahbound}]
The proof initially uses a standard duality technique, but then becomes more complex than standard proofs, as we are bounding $\thetah$ by its higher-order discrete norms, rather than the error $\eh$ by its $H^1$ norm.

Consider the adjoint variational problem: Find $w \in \HozDD$ such that for all $v \in \HozDD$
\beq\label{eq:adjointtheta}
a(v,w) = \IPLtDn{v}{\thetah}
\eeq
(i.e., $w$ solves the adjoint problem with right-hand side given by $n\thetah$). Let $\eh \de u -\uh$ be the finite-element error, and put $v = \eh$ in \cref{eq:adjointtheta}. By Galerkin orthogonality for $\eh$ and $u-\Ph u,$ we have (recalling $\eh = \rho + \thetah$)
\begin{align}
\IPLtDn{\eh}{\thetah} = a(\eh,w-\Ph w) &= \IPLtD{A \grad \rho}{\grad(w-\Ph w)}  -k^2 \IPLtDn{\eh}{w-\Ph w} -ik \IPLtGI{\eh}{w-\Ph w},\nonumber\\
&=a(\rho,w-\Ph w) -k^2 \IPLtDn{\thetah}{w-\Ph w} -ik \IPLtGI{\thetah}{w-\Ph w}\label{eq:doublego}
\end{align}

Therefore as $\eh = \rho + \thetah$ we can rearrange \cref{eq:doublego} and use Cauchy-Schwartz to obtain
\begin{align}
\NLtDn{\thetah}^2 &\leq \Cc\NLiD{n} \NW{\rho} \NW{w- \Ph w} + k^2 \abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{w- \Ph w}}\nonumber\\
&+ k \abs{\IPLtGI{\thetah}{w-\Ph w}} + \NLtDn{\rho}\NLtDn{\thetah}\label{eq:boundingLtwo}
\end{align}
By combining \cref{lem:bestapprox,lem:ellprojerr}, we can show (as $w$ satisfies an adjoint Helmholtz problem with right-hand side $\thetah$)
\beq\label{eq:wlt}
\NLtD{w - \Ph w} \leq \Cprojfn{0} \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h^2 + \CFEMttilde \CAnk h(hk)^p\mright)\NLtD{\thetah} \tand

\eeq
We will be able to use \cref{eq:wlt,eq:who} to bound terms involving $w - \Ph w$ in \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}. We first estimate the inner product terms in \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}:
\begin{align}
\abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{w- \Ph w}} &= \abs{\IPLtDn{\thetah}{\Qhn w - \Ph w}}\nonumber\\

 by \cref{eq:wlt}.

Now insert \cref{eq:wlt,eq:who,eq:innerprod1,eq:innerprod2} into \cref{eq:boundingLtwo}:
\begin{align*}
\NLtD{\thetah}^2 &\leq \Bigg[\Cc\NLiD{n} \NW{\rho} \mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright)\\

&\text{ rearranging and using \cref{lem:ellprojerr} and the fact that $hk \leq 1$}\nonumber\\
&\leq \Bigg[\mleft(\Cc\mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright) + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \Cboundaryt^{\half} + \Cprojfn{0}  \mright)\NW{\rho} \nonumber\\

\end{align*}
and therefore using Young's inequality to separate out the $\NLtD{\thetah}$ term on the right-hand side, and then move it to the left hand side, followed by \cref{eq:simple}, we obtain
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}&\leq \Bigg[\mleft(\Cc\mleft(\Cprojfn{0} + 2\Cprojfn{1}\mright) + \CMT \CinvVhp \Cprojfn{0} \Cboundaryt^{\half} + \Cprojfn{0}  \mright)\NW{\rho}\nonumber \\

&\quad\quad \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\label{eq:part3penultimate},
\end{align}
and on rearranging \cref{eq:part3penultimate} we obtain \cref{eq:ltthetahbound}.

\epf
With all our technical lemmas proved, we can now prove our main \lcnamecref{thm:fembound}.

\bpf[Proof of \cref{thm:fembound}]
By using \cref{lem:higherbound} (with $m=p-1$) in \cref{eq:ltthetahbound} and the fact that $\NLiD{n}, \En, \nvar \geq 1$, we have
\begin{align}
\NLtD{\thetah}&\leq \mleft(\Cfirst + \Csecond\Chighfn{p-1,2} \nvar^3\NLiD{n}\nmin^{2-p} \mright)\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NW{\rho}\nonumber\\
&+\Csecond  \Chighfn{p-1,1} \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)^{p-1}\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde (hk )^{p+1}+ \CFEMttilde \CAnk h^{2p}k^{2p+1}\mright)\NLtD{\thetah}\label{eq:doublehkdep}
\end{align}
Choosing $h$ according to \cref{eq:hfemcond}, \cref{eq:doublehkdep} simplifies to
\begin{align*}
\NLtD{\thetah} &\leq \mleft(\Cfirst + \Csecond\Chighfn{p-1,2} \nvar^4\nmin^{1-p} \mright)\mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\NLiD{n}^2\\
&\quad\quad\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CFEMotilde h + \CFEMttilde \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NW{\rho} + \half \NLtD{\thetah},
\end{align*}

and therefore it follows that
\beq\label{eq:ltboundwithrho}
\NLtD{\thetah} \leq \nvar^6\nmin^{-(p+1)} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1} \Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\mleft(\CLtboundo h + \CLtboundt  \CAnk (hk)^p\mright)\NW{\rho}.
\eeq

It only now remains to bound the weighted $H^1$ norm of the error. By \cref{lem:h1contdisc,lem:higherbound} (with $m=1$) we have
\begin{align}
\SNHoD{\thetah} &\leq \Amin^{\half} \mleft[\Chighfn{1,1} \mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)k \NLtD{\thetah}\mright.\nonumber\\
&\mleft.\quad\quad+ \Chighmt \nvar^3\NLiD{n} \NW{\rho}\mright],\label{eq:sntheta}
\end{align}

and by combining \cref{eq:sntheta,eq:ltboundwithrho} we obtain (as $hk \leq 1$ and $\nvar,\NLiD{n} \geq 1$)
\begin{align}
\SNHoD{\thetah} &\leq
\mleft(\mleft(\En\nvar\mright)^{\half(\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1)}\NLiD{n}\nmin^{-\frac{p}2}\mright)\nvar^6\nmin^{-(p+1)} \mleft(\En \nvar\mright)^{\floor{\frac{p-1}2}+1}\Pfn{p-2}\mleft(\NLiD{n}\mright)\nonumber\\
&\quad\quad\mleft(\CHoboundo  +\CHoboundt \CAnk k(hk)^p\mright)\NW{\rho}.\label{eq:hoboundwithrho}
\end{align}
Therefore by combining \cref{eq:ltboundwithrho,eq:hoboundwithrho}, using \cref{eq:ellprojerr,lem:scottzhang} to bound $\NW{\rho}$, and using the fact that $hk \leq 1,$ we obtain \cref{eq:femltbound,eq:femhobound}.

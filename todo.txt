- Get and Implement Ivan's comments on summary?
- spell check?
- Get Euan's feedback on declaration of authorship
- Check Bibtex/latex errors
- See Evans and Gariepy from Euan and Popov and Vodev 99b

- Check with Ivan about Duff, Erisman, and Reid reference
- Find other LU applying cost references and add in to start of nbpc
- Proofs on pages
- Get Ghanem and SPanos from Ivan, and check reference for PC
- Find reference for Laplace in radial coords - Evans?

- Formatting:
 * Big spaces in MLMC
 * change back to CM depending on what Euan says
 * Headers, titles, title page in accordance with what Paul did
 * font sizes and computer modern (or whatever) in graphs - bookmarks saved that may help
 * Overrunning lines - use draft mode
 * (If time) aligning probabilistic run graphs

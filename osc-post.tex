We construct a simple 1-dimensional example to show that the posteriors arising in Bayesian inverse problems, and the objective functions arising in inverse problems, for the Helmholtz equation are typically oscillatory/multi-modal. Whilst such a statement is commonly made in the literature (see, e.g.,\optodo{Find some references}) and observed in practive (see, e.g.,\optodo{Find more references}), we do not know of an explicit construction of such a posterior, and so we give one for a simple, 1-dimensional Helmholtz problem here.

We consider the 1-dimensional homogeneous Helmholtz equation, posed on on the interval $(-L,0)$, where ultimately $L$ will be an unknown to be determined. We impose a Dirichlet boundary condition given by an incoming plane wave and a sound-soft scatterer at $-L,$ and an outgoing impedance boundary condition at 0. That is, we consider the PDE
\beq\label{eq:app1dhh}
u'' + k^2 u = 0 \tin (-L,0),
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:app1dibc}
u(L) = -\exp(ikL) \tat -L
\eeq
\beq\label{eq:app1ddbc}
u'(0) - iku(0) = 0 \tat 0.
\eeq

We now suppose that $L$ is unknown, that we have measured $u(0)$ (with experimental error), and we wish to know the posterior distribution of $L$. A similar argument to the one presented below would also give analagous results for deterministic inverse problems for $L$. We will show that the posterior distribution of $L$ is multi-modal (that is, it has multiple local maxima/minima) and oscillates on a length scale $2\pi/k.$

To proceed, we first derive an expression for $u(0)$ as a function of $L$. We will then use this expression to formulate the Bayesian posterior for $L$, given knowledge of $u(0).$

Solutions of \eqref{eq:app1dhh} are of the form
\beqs
A\exp(ikx) + B\exp(-ikx),
\eeqs
for some (complex) constants $A$ and $B$. The impedance boundary condition \eqref{eq:app1dibc} immediately implies $B=0$. Then applying the Dirichlet boundary condition \eqref{eq:app1ddbc}\optodo{Finish this later, and talk to someone about it.}

Setup:

\item Incoming wave, gives DBC \@ $L$ - $\exp(ikx)$ for scattered wave
\item IBC \@ 0\optodo{Make sure you get the sign of the derivative correct!}
\item Helmholtz
\item think of varying $L$/consider BIP for $L$, and show that solution/posterior is an oscialltory/multi-modal function of $L$ on wavelength $2\pi/k$

What do we need to do to fix the spd fiasco?

1. Initially, go back to talking about WoiDRRRdtd, with the norm defined as the sup over the component-wise Woi norms
1a. (Also need to do this for LiDRspd, but can still use the operator norm as as equivalent norm on this space.)
2. If we want to be economical with notation, use WoiDRspd, but define it mathsily, and be very clear what the norm is (and isn't)
2a. (Consider changing the L^\infty_{\DR,op} norm notation, as maybe this isn't helpful).
3. Make sure these changes are done in chapters 2 and 3, and there's a clear explanation in Ch2 about what these different spaces are, and what the different norms are.
3a. (This will require a grep on every instance of WoiDRRRdtd and WoiDRRdtd to double check its all clear).
